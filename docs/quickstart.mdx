# Quickstart
This guide takes you through your first steps with Restate.

## Prerequisites
- Build tools for your programming language:
    - TypeScript: Latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 and [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7
    - Java: [JDK](https://whichjdk.com/) >= 17
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to run Restate
- (Optional): Restate CLI: [Installation guide](/restate/cli#installation)

## Step 1: Scaffold the project

Scaffold the project to create your first service:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

Use the [Node template](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator) to get started.
This template includes a skeleton of a TypeScript Restate service:

```shell
npx -y @restatedev/create-app@latest && cd restate-node-template
```

Get all the dependencies and build tools:

```shell
npm install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm" label="Java" default>

Grab the Java Hello world example via the Restate CLI:

```shell
restate example java-hello-world-http && cd java-hello-world-http
```

Or via `wget`:
```shell
wget https://github.com/restatedev/examples/releases/latest/download/java-hello-world-http.zip && unzip java-hello-world-http.zip -d java-hello-world-http && rm java-hello-world-http.zip
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Build and run the service

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

Now, you are all set to start developing your service in `src/app.ts`.
You can run the app with `ts-node-dev` while developing:

```shell
npm run app-dev
```

Once you have implemented your service, build the app and run it:

```shell
npm run build
npm run app
```

This starts the greeter service on port `9080`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm" label="Java" default>

You are all set to start developing your service. Building the service for the first time will generate the Protobuf related code:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

You can open the project with the IDE of your choice and configure it to build with Gradle. You can test the project with:

```shell
./gradlew check
```

Once you have implemented your service, run it:

```shell
./gradlew run
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Launch the Restate runtime

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

Run the Restate Docker container:

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d --network=host docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

:::tip
Restate is a single self-contained binary and Docker just one of the ways to run it. You can also obtain the binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases), from our [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/restatedev/homebrew-tap)
with `brew install restatedev/tap/restate`, or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-server)
with `npm install @restatedev/restate-server`.
:::

Register the service:

Now, we need to tell Restate where the service is running.

We can do this via the CLI:

```shell
restate dp add localhost:9080
```

Or via `curl`, by sending a request to the endpoint of the runtime at `http://localhost:9070/deployments`
and providing it with the deployment endpoint of the service `http://localhost:9080`.
```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```

Restate then sends a request to the service deployment to ask which services and methods
are running behind this deployment and will keep track of these (including of the method signatures).
After executing this curl request, you should see the discovered services and methods printed to your terminal.

Run the Restate Docker container:

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

with `npm install @restatedev/restate-server`.
:::

Register the services:

Now, we need to tell Restate where the service is running. To do this, we register a new "deployment" on restate server.

We can do this via the CLI:

```shell
restate dp add http://host.docker.internal:9080
```

Or via `curl`, by sending a request to the endpoint of the runtime at `http://localhost:9070/deployments`
and providing it with the deployment endpoint of the service `http://host.docker.internal:9080`.
```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:9080"}'
```

Restate then sends a request to the service deployment to ask which services and methods
are running behind this deployment and will keep track of these (including of the method signatures).
After executing this curl request, you should see the discovered services and methods printed to your terminal.

</Tabs>

## Step 4: Send requests to the service

Invoke the function via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

```shell
curl localhost:8080/myservice/hello -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"request": "Restate"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm" label="Java" default>

```shell
curl localhost:8080/greeter.Greeter/Greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Restate"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Congratulations, you managed to run your first Restate service.
