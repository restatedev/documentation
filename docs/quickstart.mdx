# Quickstart
This guide takes you through your first steps with Restate.

## Prerequisites
- Latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 and [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Step 1: Create the Node app
Use the [Node template](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator) to get started.
This template includes a skeleton of a Typescript Restate service:

```shell
npx -y @restatedev/create-app && cd restate-node-template
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies
First, get all dependencies and build tools. Then build the app:

```shell
npm install
```

Now, you are all set to start developing your service in `src/app.ts`.
You can run the app with `ts-node-dev` while developing:
```shell
npm run app-dev
```

## Step 3: Build and Run the service
Once you have implemented your service, build the app and run it:
```shell
npm run build
npm run app
```

This starts the greeter service on port 9080.

## Step 4: Launch the Restate runtime

Run the Restate Docker container:

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d --network=host docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

Register the service:

Now, we need to tell Restate where the service is running.
We do this by sending a request to the endpoint of the runtime at `http://localhost:8081/endpoints`
and providing it with the endpoint of the service `http://localhost:8080`.
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9070/endpoints -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```
Restate then sends a request to the service endpoint to ask which services and methods
are running behind this endpoint and will keep track of these (including of the method signatures).
After executing this curl request, you should see the discovered services and methods printed to your terminal.

Run the Restate Docker container:

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

Register the services:

Now, we need to tell Restate where the service is running.
We do this by sending a request to the endpoint of the runtime at `http://localhost:8081/endpoints`
and providing it with the endpoint of the service `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9070/endpoints -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:9080"}'
```
Restate then sends a request to the service endpoint to ask which services and methods
are running behind this endpoint and will keep track of these (including of the method signatures).
After executing this curl request, you should see the discovered services and methods printed to your terminal.

## Step 5: Send requests to the service

Invoke the function via:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/myservice/hello -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"request": "Pete"}'
```

Congratulations, you managed to run your first Restate service.
