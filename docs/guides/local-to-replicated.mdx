# Migrating a single-node to a multi-node deployment

By default when starting a Restate server ({'<='} v1.2), it uses the local loglet and local metadata server.
The local loglet and local metadata server are suitable for development and single-node deployments.
However, for production deployments, it is recommended to use the replicated loglet and replicated metadata server to ensure high availability and durability.
This guide shows how to migrate an existing single-node deployment to use the replicated loglet and replicated metadata server without losing any data.
By using the replicated loglet and replicated metadata server, you can also scale your deployment to multiple nodes.

This guide assumes you have a running single-node Restate server that uses the local loglet and local metadata server.

<Step stepLabel="1" title="Enable the replicated metadata server">

To use the replicated metadata server, you need to change the metadata server type to `replicated` in the Restate configuration file.
Once you restart your Restate server, it will start using the replicated metadata server and automatically migrate the local metadata.

```toml restate.toml
[metadata-server]
type = "replicated"
```

If you plan to extend your single-node deployment to a multi-node deployment, you also need to [configure the snapshot repository](/operate/data-backup#snapshotting).
This allows new nodes to join the cluster by restoring the latest snapshot.

```toml restate.toml
[worker.snapshots]
destination = "s3://snapshots-bucket/cluster-prefix"
```

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="2" title="Enable the replicated loglet">

To be able to use the replicated loglet, make sure the node includes the `log-server` role as following.

```toml restate.toml
roles = [
    "worker",
    "admin",
    "metadata-server",
    "log-server"
]
```

To use the replicated loglet, you need to reconfigure the cluster configuration to use the replicated loglet as the default log provider.
You can do this by using [`restatectl`](/references/restatectl#getting-restatectl).

```shell
restatectl config set --log-provider replicated --log-replication 1
```

This command sets the default log provider to `replicated` with a default replication of `1`.
As long as you have a single-node deployment, you must set the replication to `1`.
Otherwise, the server will become unavailable because it cannot provision the new log segments.
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="3" title="Verify the changes">

You can verify that the changes have been applied by checking the cluster status.

```shell
restatectl status
```

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="4" title="Create snapshots to allow other nodes to join">

For other nodes to join, you need to snapshot every partition because the local loglet is not accessible from other nodes.
Run the following command to create a snapshot for each partition.

```shell
restatectl snapshots create
```

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title="Turn a single-node into a multi-node deployment">

To add more nodes to your cluster, you need to start new Restate servers with the same `cluster-name` and a metadata client with the address of the existing node.
If you want the new nodes to participate in the replicated metadata cluster, then they should run the `metadata-server` role and use the `replicated` metadata server.

```toml restate.toml
roles = ["metadata-server", "admin", "worker", "log-server"]
cluster-name = "my-cluster"

[metadata-client]
addresses = ["ADVERTISED_ADDRESS_OF_EXISTING_NODE"]

[metadata-server]
type = "replicated"
```

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="6" title="Verify that your cluster consists of multiple nodes">

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the new nodes in the cluster status.

```shell
restatectl status
```

</Step>
