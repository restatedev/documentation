# Durable webhooks

Restate handlers can be used as the endpoint for webhook callbacks.

Your handler then acts as a durable event processor that ensures that each event is processed exactly once, and that none of them get lost.

You don't need to do anything special!

## Example
This example processes webhook callbacks from a payment provider.

The payment provider notifies us about payment success or failure of invoices by sending webhook events to our handler.
The handler then routes the event to the correct processor via a one-way message.
