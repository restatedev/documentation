# Deploying a distributed Restate cluster using Docker

This guide shows how to deploy a distributed Restate cluster consisting of 3 nodes using Docker and Docker compose.

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
    - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
</Admonition>

<Step stepLabel="1" title="Deploy the Restate cluster using Docker">

To deploy a 3 node distributed Restate cluster, copy the `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up`.

```yaml
# Common environment variables for all restate nodes
x-environment: &default-env
  # To customize logging, check https://docs.restate.dev/operate/monitoring/logging
  RESTATE_LOG_FILTER: "restate=info"
  # Cluster name, this will be visible in few places such as logs
  RESTATE_CLUSTER_NAME: "my-cluster"
  # In this setup every node fulfills every role.
  # For more info on disaggregated setups, check https://docs.restate.dev/deploy/server/cluster/
  RESTATE_ROLES: '["admin","worker","log-server","metadata-server"]'
  # Internal metadata and log server configuration
  RESTATE_BIFROST__DEFAULT_PROVIDER: "replicated"
  RESTATE_BIFROST__REPLICATED_LOGLET__DEFAULT_LOG_REPLICATION: 2
  RESTATE_METADATA_SERVER__TYPE: "replicated"
  # This needs to be configured with the hostnames/ports the nodes can use to talk to each other.
  # In this setup, they interact within the "internal" Docker compose network setup.
  RESTATE_METADATA_CLIENT__ADDRESSES: '["http://restate-1:5122","http://restate-2:5122","http://restate-3:5122"]'
  # Only one node provisions the cluster, meaning only one container needs this config to be 'true'
  RESTATE_AUTO_PROVISION: "false"

# Common containers configuration
x-variables:
  common_settings: &common_settings
    image: docker.io/restatedev/restate:1.2
    ports:
      # node port

```

The cluster uses the `replicated` Bifrost provider and replicates data to 2 nodes.
Since we are running with 3 nodes, the cluster can tolerate 1 node failure without becoming unavailable.

The `replicated` metadata cluster consists of all nodes since they all run the `metadata-server` role.
Since the `replicated` metadata cluster requires a majority quorum to operate, the cluster can tolerate 1 node failure without becoming unavailable.

Take a look at the [cluster deployment documentation](/deploy/server/cluster) for more information on how to configure and deploy a distributed Restate cluster.

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="2" title="Check the cluster status">
    You can check the status of the cluster by running the `restatectl status` command on any of the started Restate servers.
    Note, it might take a few seconds until the cluster has fully started and the status is available.

    ```shell
    docker compose exec restate-1 restatectl status
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="3" title={<span><a href={"/get_started/quickstart"}>Start a local Restate service</a></span>}/>

<Step stepLabel="4" title="Register the service endpoint">
    You can register the service endpoint at any of the started Restate nodes since they all run the `admin` role.

    ```shell
    restate dp register http://host.docker.internal:9080
    ```

    Or alternatively you can open the Restate UI at http://localhost:9080 and register the service endpoint there.
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title="Invoke the service">
    You can invoke the registered service at any of the started Restate nodes since they all run the ingress.

    ```shell
    curl localhost:8080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Sarah"' &&
    curl localhost:28080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Bob"' &&
    curl localhost:38080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Eve"'
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="6" title="Kill and restart Restate servers">
    Try killing and restarting one of the Restate nodes and see how the cluster reacts.
    ```shell
    docker compose kill restate-1 &&
    sleep 5 &&
    docker compose up -d restate-1
    ```
</Step>

<Step end={true} stepLabel="ðŸŽ‰" title="Congratulations, you managed to run your first distributed Restate cluster and simulated some failures!"/>


Here are some next steps for you to try:

- Try to configure a 5 server Restate cluster that can tolerate up to 2 server failures.
- Try to deploy a 3 server Restate cluster using Kubernetes.
