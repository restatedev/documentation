# Deploying a distributed Restate cluster using Docker

This guide shows how to deploy a distributed Restate cluster consisting of 3 nodes using Docker and Docker compose.

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
    - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
</Admonition>

<Step stepLabel="1" title="Deploy the Restate cluster using Docker">

To deploy a 3 node distributed Restate cluster, create a file `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up`.

```yaml docker-compose.yml
x-environment: &common-env
  RESTATE_CLUSTER_NAME: "restate-cluster"
  # Every node runs every role
  RESTATE_ROLES: '["admin", "worker", "log-server", "metadata-server"]'
  # For more on logging, see: https://docs.restate.dev/operate/monitoring/logging
  RESTATE_LOG_FILTER: "restate=info"
  RESTATE_BIFROST__DEFAULT_PROVIDER: "replicated"
  RESTATE_BIFROST__REPLICATED_LOGLET__DEFAULT_LOG_REPLICATION: 2  # We require minimum of 2 nodes to accept writes
  RESTATE_METADATA_SERVER__TYPE: "replicated"
  # The addresses where nodes can reach each other over the "internal" Docker Compose network
  RESTATE_METADATA_CLIENT__ADDRESSES: '["http://restate-1:5122","http://restate-2:5122","http://restate-3:5122"]'
  # Partition snapshotting, see: https://docs.restate.dev/operate/snapshots
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__DESTINATION: "s3://restate/snapshots"
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_NUM_RECORDS: "1000"
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__AWS_REGION: "local"
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__AWS_ENDPOINT_URL: "http://minio:9000"
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__AWS_ALLOW_HTTP: true
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "minioadmin"
  RESTATE_WORKER__SNAPSHOTS__AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "minioadmin"

      RESTATE_AUTO_PROVISION: "false"

  minio:
    image: quay.io/minio/minio
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh"
    # Ensure a bucket called "restate" exists on startup:
    command: "-c 'mkdir -p /data/restate && /usr/bin/minio server --quiet /data'"
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
```

The cluster uses the `replicated` Bifrost provider and replicates log writes to a minimum of 2 nodes.
Since we are running with 3 nodes, the cluster can tolerate 1 node failure without becoming unavailable.
By default, partition state is replicated to all workers (though each partition has only one acting leader at a time).

The `replicated` metadata cluster consists of all nodes since they all run the `metadata-server` role.
Since the `replicated` metadata cluster requires a majority quorum to operate, the cluster can tolerate 1 node failure without becoming unavailable.

Take a look at the [cluster deployment documentation](/deploy/server/cluster) for more information on how to configure and deploy a distributed Restate cluster.
In this example we also deployed a Minio server to host the cluster snapshots bucket. Visit [Snapshots](/operate/snapshots) to learn more about whis is strongly recommended for all clusters.

<Step stepLabel="2" title="Check the cluster status">
    You can check the status of the cluster by running the `restatectl status` command on any of the started Restate servers.
    Note, it might take a few seconds until the cluster has fully started and the status is available.

    ```shell
    docker compose exec restate-1 restatectl status
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="3" title={<span><a href={"/get_started/quickstart"}>Start a local Restate service</a></span>}/>

<Step stepLabel="4" title="Register the service endpoint">
    You can register the service endpoint at any of the started Restate nodes since they all run the `admin` role.

    ```shell
    restate dp register http://host.docker.internal:9080
    ```

    Or alternatively you can open the Restate UI at http://localhost:9080 and register the service endpoint there.
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title="Invoke the service">
    You can invoke the registered service at any of the started Restate nodes since they all run the ingress.

    ```shell
    curl localhost:8080/Greeter/greet --json '"Sarah"' &&
    curl localhost:28080/Greeter/greet --json '"Bob"' &&
    curl localhost:38080/Greeter/greet --json '"Eve"'
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="6" title="Kill and restart Restate servers">
    Try killing and restarting one of the Restate nodes and see how the cluster reacts.
    ```shell
    docker compose kill restate-1 &&
    sleep 5 &&
    docker compose up -d restate-1
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="7" title="Create snapshots">
    Try instructing the partition processors to create a snapshot of their state in the object store bucket:
    ```shell
    docker compose exec restate-1 restatectl snapshot create
    ```
    Navigate to the Minio console at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and browse the bucket contents (default credentials: `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`).
</Step>

<Step end={true} stepLabel="ðŸŽ‰" title="Congratulations, you managed to run your first distributed Restate cluster and simulated some failures!"/>


Here are some next steps for you to try:

- Try to configure a 5 server Restate cluster that can tolerate up to 2 server failures.
- Trim the logs (either manually, or by setting up automatic trimming) _before_ adding more nodes.
- Try to deploy a 3 server Restate cluster using Kubernetes.
