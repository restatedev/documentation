# Deploying a distributed Restate cluster using Docker

This guide shows how to deploy a distributed Restate cluster consisting of 3 nodes using Docker and Docker compose.

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
    - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
</Admonition>

<Step stepLabel="1" title="Deploy the Restate cluster using Docker">

To deploy a 3 node distributed Restate cluster, copy the `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up`.

```yaml
x-environment: &default-env
  RESTATE_CLUSTER_NAME: "my-cluster"
  RESTATE_ROLES: '["admin","worker","log-server","metadata-server"]'
  RESTATE_LOG_FILTER: "restate=info"
  RESTATE_AUTO_PROVISION: "false"
  RESTATE_BIFROST__DEFAULT_PROVIDER: "replicated"
  RESTATE_BIFROST__REPLICATED_LOGLET__DEFAULT_LOG_REPLICATION: 2
  RESTATE_METADATA_SERVER__TYPE: "replicated"
  RESTATE_METADATA_CLIENT__ADDRESSES: '["http://node1:5122","http://node2:5122","http://node3:5122"]'

x-variables:
  common_settings: &common_settings
    # todo: Update to ghcr.io/restatedev/restate:1.2 once it is released
    image: ghcr.io/restatedev/restate:main
    ports:
      # node port
      - 5122
      # admin port
      - 9070
      # admin query port
      - 9071
      # ingress port
      - 8080

services:
  node1:
    <<: *common_settings
    ports:
      - "5122:5122"
      - "9070:9070"
      - "9071:9071"
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      <<: *default-env
      RESTATE_NODE_NAME: node1
      RESTATE_FORCE_NODE_ID: 1
      RESTATE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS: "http://node1:5122"
      # only node1 is allowed to provision the cluster
      RESTATE_AUTO_PROVISION: "true"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  node2:
    <<: *common_settings
    ports:
      - "25122:5122"
      - "29070:9070"
      - "29071:9071"
      - "28080:8080"
    environment:
      <<: *default-env
      RESTATE_NODE_NAME: node2
      RESTATE_FORCE_NODE_ID: 2
      RESTATE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS: "http://node2:5122"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  node3:
    <<: *common_settings
    ports:
      - "35122:5122"
      - "39070:9070"
      - "39071:9071"
      - "38080:8080"
    environment:
      <<: *default-env
      RESTATE_NODE_NAME: node3
      RESTATE_FORCE_NODE_ID: 3
      RESTATE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS: "http://node3:5122"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

The cluster uses the `replicated` Bifrost provider and replicates data to 2 nodes.
Since we are running with 3 nodes, the cluster can tolerate 1 node failure without becoming unavailable.

The `replicated` metadata cluster consists of all nodes since they all run the `metadata-server` role.
Since the `replicated` metadata cluster requires a majority quorum to operate, the cluster can tolerate 1 node failure without becoming unavailable.

Take a look at the [cluster deployment documentation](/deploy/cluster) for more information on how to configure and deploy a distributed Restate cluster.

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="2" title="Check the cluster status">
    You can check the status of the cluster by running the `restatectl status` command on any of the started Restate servers.
    Note, it might take a few seconds until the cluster has fully started and the status is available.

    ```shell
    docker compose exec node1 restatectl status
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="3" title={<span><a href={"/get_started/quickstart"}>Start a local Restate service</a></span>}/>

<Step stepLabel="4" title="Register the service endpoint">
    You can register the service endpoint at any of the started Restate nodes since they all run the `admin` role.

    ```shell
    docker compose exec node2 restate dp register http://host.docker.internal:9080
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title="Invoke the service">
    You can invoke the registered service at any of the started Restate nodes since they all run the ingress.

    ```shell
    curl localhost:8080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Sarah"' &&
    curl localhost:28080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Bob"' &&
    curl localhost:38080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Eve"'
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="6" title="Kill and restart Restate servers">
    Try killing and restarting one of the Restate nodes and see how the cluster reacts.
    ```shell
    docker compose kill node1 &&
    sleep 5 &&
    docker compose up -d node1
    ```
</Step>

<Step end={true} stepLabel="ðŸŽ‰" title="Congratulations, you managed to run your first distributed Restate cluster and simulated some failures!"/>


Here are some next steps for you to try:

- Try to configure a 5 server Restate cluster that can tolerate up to 2 server failures.
- Try to deploy a 3 server Restate cluster using Kubernetes.
