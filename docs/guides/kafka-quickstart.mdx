# Restate + Kafka: Quickstart

In this guide, you will learn how to connect your Restate service handler to a Kafka topic.


Restate lets you connect any handler to a Kafka topic, and invoke the handler for each event that arrives on the topic.
This way, you can use Restate to process events in a lightweight, flexible, transactional way.

<Admonition type={"info"}>
    The purpose of this guide is to get your setup working.
    If you are interested in the benefits and the things you can do with Restate's Kafka integration, have a look at the [Event Processing use case page](/use-cases/event-processing).

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
    - [The prerequisites for running a Restate service of your preferred language](/get_started/quickstart)
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
</Admonition>

<Step stepLabel="1" title={<span><a href={"/get_started/quickstart"}>Get the Greeter service template and run the service</a></span>}>
    You can choose any of the SDK languages for this quickstart.
    You do not need to adapt the handler code to be able to read from Kafka.
    Any handler can be connected to Kafka.

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="2" title={"Start the Kafka cluster"}>

    Let's start a Kafka cluster with a single broker, and create a topic named `greetings`.

    You can run your Kafka cluster in your preferred way. Here, we will use Docker Compose to start a Kafka cluster.

    Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

    ```yaml docker-compose.yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
        broker:
            image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0
            container_name: broker
            ports:
                - "9092:9092"
                - "9101:9101"
            environment:
                KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
                KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT
                KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://broker:29092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:9092
                KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
                KAFKA_GROUP_INITIAL_REBALANCE_DELAY_MS: 0
                KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR: 1
                KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
                KAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES: broker,controller
                KAFKA_NODE_ID: 1
                KAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS: 1@broker:29093
                KAFKA_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://broker:29092,CONTROLLER://broker:29093,PLAINTEXT_HOST://0.0.0.0:9092
                KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: PLAINTEXT
                KAFKA_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES: CONTROLLER
                KAFKA_LOG_DIRS: /tmp/kraft-combined-logs
                CLUSTER_ID: MkU3OEVBNTcwNTJENDM2Qk

        init-kafka:
            image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0
            depends_on:
                - broker
            entrypoint: [ '/bin/sh', '-c' ]
            command: |
                "# blocks until kafka is reachable
                kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:29092 --list
                echo -e 'Creating kafka topics'
                kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:29092 --create --if-not-exists --topic greetings --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

                echo -e 'Successfully created the following topics:'
                kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:29092 --list"
    ```

    Start the Kafka broker:

    ```shell
    docker compose up
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="3" title={"Running Restate Server"}>

    Now, let's start the Restate Server and let it know about the Kafka cluster via the configuration file.

    Store the following configuration in a file named `restate.toml`:

    ```toml restate.toml
    [[ingress.kafka-clusters]]
    name = "my-cluster"
    brokers = ["PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092"]
    ```

    Start the Restate Server from the same location as the configuration file:

    ```shell
    restate-server --config-file restate.toml
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="4" title={"Register the service"}>

    Let the Restate Server know about the Greeter service by registering it:

    ```shell
    restate deployments register localhost:9080
    ```
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title={"Connect the handler to the topic"}>

    Now, we need to make Restate subscribe to the Kafka topics and tell it where it should push the events that arrive on the topic.

    Execute the following curl command to create a subscription, and invoke the handler for each event:

    ```shell
    curl localhost:9070/subscriptions --json '{
        "source": "kafka://my-cluster/greetings",
        "sink": "service://Greeter/greet",
        "options": {"auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}
    }'
    ```

    For Go, you need to capitalize the handler name: `service://Greeter/Greet`.

    This curl command calls the Admin API of the Restate Server and tells it to invoke the `greet` handler of the `Greeter` service for each event that arrives on the `greetings` topic in the `my-cluster` Kafka cluster.
</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title={"Invoke the handler by publishing an event"}>

    Create a Kafka producer and publish an event to the `greetings` topic:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it broker kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server broker:29092 --topic greetings
    ```

    Then type a message and press enter. The greeter takes a String name as an input:

    ```
    "Sarah"
    ```


</Step>

<Step stepLabel="🥳" title={"We invoked a Restate service over Kafka"}>
    You now see your handler getting invoked. The greeter template implements a handler which probabilistically fails.
    You can see the retries and the eventual success in the logs.

    The way this worked is that Restate reads the message off the Kafka topic and durably persisted it, similar to what it does for HTTP invocations.

    It then **pushed** the message to the handler, as opposed to the pull mechanism that you would have with a Kafka consumer.

    When the handler failed, Restate handled the retry requests and eventually succeeded.

    When invoking services, Restates ignores the key of the message.

    If your service would be a Virtual Object, Restate would use the key of the Kafka message to determine the Virtual Object ID.
    Whereas a Kafka partition contains multiple keys, Restate effectively keeps track of a queue per key.

    Have a look at the [Event Processing use case page](/use-cases/event-processing) to learn about what you can do with Restate and event processing.

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="🏁" title={"Cleanup: removing the subscription"}>

    You can see the subscriptions that are active via the Admin API:

    <Terminal>
        ```shell !command
        curl localhost:9070/subscriptions
        ```

        ```json !output
        {
            "subscriptions": [
                {
                    "id": "sub_11XHoawrCiWtv8kzhEyGtsR",
                    "source": "kafka://my-cluster/my-topic",
                    "sink": "service://Greeter/greet",
                    "options": {
                        "auto.offset.reset": "earliest",
                        "client.id": "restate",
                        "group.id": "sub_11XHoawrCiWtv8kzhEyGtsR"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    </Terminal>

    As you can see, subscriptions have an ID that starts with `sub_`.

    Now you can use the subscription ID to delete the subscription:

    ```shell
    curl -X DELETE localhost:9070/subscriptions/sub_11XHoawrCiWtv8kzhEyGtsR
    ```
