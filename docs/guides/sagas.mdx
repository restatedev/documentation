# Sagas

When building distributed systems, it is crucial to ensure that the system remains consistent even in the presence of failures.
One way to achieve this is by using the [Saga pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/saga/saga).

<Admonition type={"tip"} title={"What is a Saga?"}>
    A *Saga* is a design pattern for handling transactions that span multiple services.
    It breaks the process into a sequence of local operations, each with a corresponding **compensating action**.

    If a failure occurs partway through, these compensations are triggered to **undo** completed steps, ensuring your system stays consistent even when things go wrong.

## How does Restate help?

Restate makes it easy to implement resilient sagas in your code:
- **Durable Execution**: Restate guarantees that your code runs to completion. If a failure occurs, Restate automatically retries from the point of failure and ensures that all compensations run.
- **Resilience built-in**: No need to manually track state or retry logic. Restate handles all persistence and compensation orchestration for you.
- **Code-first approach**: Define sagas using regular code, no DSLs. Track compensations in a list, and execute them on failure.

## Example

Here is a typical travel booking workflow, where you book a flight, then rent a car, and finally book a hotel.
If any step fails, we want to roll back the previous steps to keep the system consistent.

**Restate lets us implement this purely in code without any DSLs or extra infrastructure.**
- Wrap your business logic in a try-block, and throw a terminal error for cases where you want to compensate and finish.
- For each step you do in your try-block, add a compensation to a list.
- In the catch block, in case of a terminal error, you run the compensations in reverse order, and rethrow the error.

Note that for Golang we use `defer` to run the compensations at the end.

## When to use Sagas

Restate automatically retries all transient failures, like network hiccups or temporary service outages. But not all failures are temporary.

In this case, sagas are essential:

1. **Business logic requirements**:
    - Some failures are not transient but a business decision (e.g. “Hotel is full” or “Driver license not accepted”), retrying won't help.
    - In this case, you can throw a terminal error to stop the execution and trigger the compensations.


2. **User/system-initiated cancellations**:
    - If a user [cancels](/operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations) a long-running invocation (say via UI or CLI), this triggers a terminal error.
    - Restate will not retry.
    - Again, a saga can kick in to undo previous successful operations so the system doesn't end up in an inconsistent state (e.g., booking a hotel but not a car).

## Idempotency and compensations

Since sagas in Restate are implemented in user code, compensations are flexible and powerful, as long as they're idempotent.
You can reset service state, call other services to undo prior actions, use `ctx.run` to delete rows or reverse database operations.

Depending on the characteristics of the API, you might need to register compensations at different points in your code:

1. **Two-step APIs**: First you _reserve_, then _confirm_ or _cancel_. Register the compensation after reservation, when you have the resource ID.
Reservations that are not confirmed, get automatically cancelled by the API after a timeout.

    ```
</CodeWithTabs>


2. **One-shot APIs with idempotency key**: First, you generate an idempotency key and persist it in Restate. Then, you register the compensation, and finally call the API.
We need to register the compensation before calling the API, because there is a chance that the API call succeeded but that we never got the confirmation. So in this case, we need to roll back to a consistent state.
