# Sagas

When building distributed systems, it is crucial to ensure that the system remains consistent even in the presence of failures.
One way to achieve this is by using the [Saga pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/saga/saga).

Sagas are a way to manage transactions that span multiple services.
They allow you to run compensations when your code crashes halfway through.
This way, you can ensure that your system remains consistent even in the presence of failures.

## When to use Sagas

Restate runs invocations till completion, with infinite retries and recovery of partial progress.
In that sense, you do not require to run compensations in between retries. Restate will start the retry attempt from the point where the invocation failed.

However, there can still be cases in your business logic where you want to stop a handler from executing any further and run compensations for the work done so far.
For example, when you throw a terminal error, you might want to undo previous steps.

You will also need sagas to end up in a consistent state when you [cancel an invocation](operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations).
For example, if an invocation gets stuck because an external system is not responding, you might want to stop executing the invocation while keeping the overall system state consistent.

## Implementing Sagas in Restate

Letâ€™s assume we want to build a travel booking application.
The core of our application is the `Travel` service that first tries to book the flight, then rents a car, and finally processes the customerâ€™s payment before confirming the flight and car rental.

Now let us assume that we want to offer our customers a way to cancel their booking.
If a user cancels her booking while the `Travel` service is still trying to rent a car, then, ideally, we would be able to cancel the invocation exactly at this point so that we donâ€™t start processing the payment.
Moreover, we need to cancel the already booked flight.
Otherwise, the airline might charge us for the plane ticket and we remain stuck with the costs.

**Restate lets you implement this by wrapping the steps in a try-catch, and running compensations in the catch block.
In the try block, you track the compensations by adding them to a list.
In the catch block, you run the compensations in reverse order, and rethrow the terminal error.**

These compensations are executed with the same guarantees as the service code. So Restate ensures that the compensations will complete.
As part of these compensations, it is for example possible to reset the state of the service, call other services to undo previously executed calls, or run `sideEffects` to delete previously inserted rows in a database.
