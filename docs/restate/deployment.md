# Deployment

Restate is a single binary that contains everything you need to host an environment. See
the [Get Restate](https://restate.dev/get-restate/) page for various ways of obtaining it.

The server process exposes four services by default, available on different ports:

| Name      | Port | Description                                                                                                                    | Protocol                                          |
|-----------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Node-ctrl | 5122 | control port for restate server nodes                                                                                          | gRPC + HTTP for prometheus metrics `/metrics`     |
| Ingress   | 8080 | Acts as an API gateway for all services registered with Restate                                                                | gRPC + [Connect Protocol](https://connect.build/) |
| Admin     | 9070 | Allows for CRUD operations on service/service deployment metadata, eg for service registration                                 | REST                                              |
| Postgres  | 9071 | Exposes Restate RocksDB read-only storage operations using the Postgres protocol. See [Introspection](/services/introspection) | Postgres                                          |

It will store metadata and RocksDB data in the relative directory of /target under the current working directory of the
process.

The Restate server requires outbound connectivity to the services you deploy in order to discover and send requests to
them.

In the next sections we will show you two different ways to deploy Restate on your own infrastructure.

## Kubernetes

The recommended Kubernetes deployment strategy is a one-replica StatefulSet. We recommend installing Restate in its own
namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: restate
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: restate
  namespace: restate
spec:
  serviceName: restate
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: restate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: restate
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: restate
          image: docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
          env:
            - name: RESTATE_TRACING__LOG_FORMAT
              value: Json
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9070
              name: admin
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: ingress
            - containerPort: 9071
              name: storage
            - containerPort: 5122
              name: metrics
          resources:
            requests: # you may need to adjust these for your use case
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 1Gi
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /target
              name: storage
            - mountPath: /tmp
              name: tmp
      volumes:
        - emptyDir: { }
          name: tmp
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: storage
        labels:
          app: restate
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 64Gi # for example; this is often expandable later anyway
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: restate
  namespace: restate
spec:
  selector:
    app: restate
  ports:
    - port: 9070
      name: admin
    - port: 8080
      name: ingress
    - port: 9071
      name: storage
    - port: 5122
      name: metrics
  type: ClusterIP
```

:::tip Restate Kubernetes Operator
If you want to run multiple Restate clusters in Kubernetes, or want advanced functionality like online volume expansion
and network policies, you can also use the [Restate Operator](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-operator). Details
of how to install it and deploy a cluster can be found in the README.

## Amazon EC2 with CDK

The [Restate CDK support library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-cdk) provides convenient constructs
for managing Restate server deployments on AWS. We currently offer support for a simple single-node deployment to Amazon
EC2.

If you don't have an existing CDK project, follow the
CDK [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html) page to set one up.

### Adding the Restate CDK support library

Add the Restate CDK support library to your project:

```shell
npm install @restatedev/restate-cdk
```

### Deploying a single-node Restate server

The `SingleNodeRestateDeployment` construct deploys a single-node server on Amazon EC2, suitable for development
purposes. An EC2 instance will be created in a new internet-connected VPC â€“ alternatively, you can provide one
explicitly. You can optionally enable tracing integration, which will grant the instance role permission to send traces
to AWS X-Ray.

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-cdk";

const environment = new restate.SingleNodeRestateDeployment(this, "Restate", {
	restateTag: "latest",
	tracing: restate.TracingMode.AWS_XRAY,
	logGroup: new logs.LogGroup(scope, "RestateLogs", {
		logGroupName: "/restate/server-logs",
		retention: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH,
	}),
});
```

See [deploying Restate services on AWS Lambda with CDK](/services/deployment/cdk) for more information on deploying
services.
