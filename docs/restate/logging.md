# Logging

By default, Restate logs INFO, WARN and ERROR events using a pretty format.

A complete list of configuration options is available in the [configuration documentation](/restate/configuration).

## Log filter

You can modify the filter used for log events setting the configuration entry `observability.log.filter`, or alternatively setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. Check the [`RUST_LOG` documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) for more details about the filter format. For example to enable debug logs on all restate components, and info on other logs, set the filter as `info,restate=debug`. See the paragraph below [components and log events](#components-and-log-event-context-fields) for more details about filter targets.

## Log format

You can modify the log format by setting the configuration entry `observability.log.format` as follows:

* `Pretty`: Very verbose pretty format with rendered error descriptions, when available
* `Compact`: Compact single line format
* `Json`: Newline delimited json format

## Components and log event context fields

The following components are producing relevant logs:

* `restate_ingress_grpc`: The component ingesting gRPC/Connect HTTP requests inside Restate
* `restate_meta`: The component responsible for holding the metadata informations and executing service discovery
* `restate_invoker`: The component interacting with deployed service deployments
* `restate_worker::partition::state_machine`: The state machine effects
* `restate_storage`: Restate storage layer
* `hyper`: The HTTP library

Most log events generated by Restate will also have the following attached attributes:

* `rpc.service`: The related service
* `rpc.method`: The related method
* `restate.invocation.id`: The [invocation identifier](/services/invocation#invocation-identifier)

## Recommendations

When testing Restate locally, we recommend keeping the default configuration.

When deploying in production, we recommend setting the log level to `info` and enabling the `Json` format in conjunction with a log collector, so you can later inspect and filter logs based on its event fields.

We recommend to set up logging to a more verbose filter, and use the `Pretty` format. Some example filters:

* `info,restate_ingress_grpc=trace,restate_invoker=trace,restate=debug,hyper=debug` for network related issues
* `info,restate_worker::partition::effects=debug` to get insights on the state machine effects
* `info,restate_meta=trace` to check service discovery and registration
