# Tour of Restate

This tutorial guides you through the development of an end-to-end Restate application, and covers all the essential features.
After this tutorial, you should have a firm understanding of how Restate can help you and feel comfortable to tackle your next application on your own.

This tutorial implements a ticket reservation application for a theatre.
It allows users to add tickets for specific seats to their shopping cart.
After the user adds a ticket, the seat gets reserved for 15 minutes.
If the user doesn't pay for the ticket within that time interval, the reservation is released and the ticket becomes available to other users.

Restate is a system for building distributed applications.
Applications consist of a set of services with RPC functions defined in them.
The ticket example has three services, with the following functions:
1. **User session**: keeps track of the tickets in the shopping cart.
2. **Ticket service**: manages the tickets.
3. **Checkout**: handles the checkout process of the ticket sale.

As we go, you will discover how Restate can help you with some intricacies in this application.

## Prerequisites
> &#x1F4DD; As long as Restate hasn't been launched publicly, you need to have access to the private Restate npm packages and Docker container. Please follow the instructions in the [restate-dist/README](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-dist) to set up access:

- Latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 and [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7 installed.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) to launch the Restate runtime (not needed for the app implementation itself).
- [curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get)

This guide is written for:
- Typescript SDK version: `@restatedev/restate-sdk:VAR::TYPESCRIPT_SDK_VERSION`
- Restate runtime Docker image: `restate-dist:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION`

## 🚀 Let's get started!

### Setting up the tutorial
Clone the GitHub repository of the [tutorial](https://github.com/restatedev/tour-of-restate-typescript):
```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch vVAR::TOUR_VERSION git@github.com:restatedev/tour-of-restate-typescript.git
```

This GitHub repository contains the basic skeleton of the NodeJS/Typescript services that you develop in this tutorial.

First, get all dependencies and build tools. Then build the app:
```shell
npm install && npm run build
```

### Running the services and runtime
Run the services:
```shell
npm run app
```

Launch the runtime:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d --network=host ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -p 8081:8081 -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 5432:5432 ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can consult the runtime logs via `docker logs restate_dev`.

When you are done with the tutorial, stop the runtime with `docker stop restate_dev`. This command also wipes the state (because you used the `--rm` flag).

To do resilience experiments later on, you can restart the runtime (without losing state) with `docker restart restate_dev`.

Register the services:

Now, we need to tell Restate where the service runs.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

You do this by sending a request to the endpoint of the runtime at `http://localhost:8081/endpoints`
and providing it with the endpoint of the service `http://localhost:8080`.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/endpoints -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:8080"}'
```

Restate then sends a request to the service endpoint to ask which services and methods run behind this endpoint.
This way Restate keeps track of which services run where (including of the method signatures),
and knows how to invoke a specific service.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

You do this by sending a request to the endpoint of the runtime at `http://localhost:8081/endpoints`
and providing it with the endpoint of the service `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/endpoints -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:8080"}'
```

Restate then sends a request to the service endpoint to ask which services and methods run behind this endpoint.
This way Restate keeps track of which services run where (including of the method signatures),
and knows how to invoke a specific service.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should now see the registered services printed out to your terminal:

```json
{
  "id": "bG9jYWxob3N0OjgwODAv",
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "TicketService",
      "revision": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "UserSession",
      "revision": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Checkout",
      "revision": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

<details><summary>Show the runtime logs</summary>
When you look at the logs of the runtime you see:

```

</details>


### Calling the services

Mimic adding a ticket to a cart, by calling `UserSession/addTicket` as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/UserSession/addTicket \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"key": "123", "request": "456"}'
```

If this prints out `true`, then you have a working setup.

You can call the `UserSession/checkout` function to proceed with the purchase, as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/UserSession/checkout \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"key": "123"}'
```

In `src/app`, you find the skeletons of the services where you can start implementing your app.
The `app.ts` file contains the definition of the Restate server that serves the functions.

## Services and concurrency

Two types of Restate services exist:
1. **Keyed service**:
All service invocations are sharded on a user-defined key.
Function invocations of keyed services are serialized on the user-defined key.
Therefore, at most one function can run at a time for a given key within such service.
2. **Unkeyed service**:
No key defined.
No concurrency guarantees or limitations.
Invocations are processed as they come in.
You would get the same behavior with a keyed service with random keys.

### Specifying the service type

You specify an unkeyed service by creating a router with its set of functions:

```typescript
const serviceRouter = restate.router({
  hello: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, request: Request) => { ... },
  callMe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => { ... },
  maybe: async () => { ... }
});
```

The functions of an unkeyed router have two optional parameters:

* A `ctx` of type `restate.RpcContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
* A `request` of type JSON object which represents additional invocation data.

You can choose the parameter names differently.

You specify a keyed service by creating a keyed router with its set of functions:

```typescript
const keyedServiceRouter = restate.keyedRouter({
  hello: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, key: string, request: Request) => { ... },
  callMe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, key: string) => { ... },
  maybe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => { ... },
  withSomething: async () => { ... }
});
```

The functions of a keyed router have three optional parameters

* A `ctx` of type `restate.RpcContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
* A `key` parameter of type string which represents the key of the invoked service.
* A `request` parameter of type JSON object which represents additional invocation data.

You can choose the parameter names differently.

As mentioned, for keyed services there can be at most one concurrent invocation at the service level.
So this means that if there is a call to `hello()`, then a call to `callMe()`, then `callMe()` will wait in line until `hello()` has finished, if and only if both were invoked with the same value of `key`.
until the call to `hello()` has finished successfully.
This also counts for the `maybe()` and `withSomething()` functions,
even though the key parameter was omitted from their signatures.

You export the `service` API by creating a service API instance which specifies under which path the service is reachable:

```typescript
export const serviceApi: restate.ServiceApi<typeof serviceRouter> = {
  path: "myServicePath",
};
```

:::tip
The concurrency guarantees of keyed services makes it a lot easier to reason about interaction with external systems.

Imagine you have a keyed service which is the single writer to a database and every key only interacts with an isolated set of database rows.
Then you can scale your application and never have concurrent invocations writing to the same database row.
This resolves common data consistency issues such as lost updates or non-repeatable reads.

Have a look at the product service of the [shopping cart example](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/typescript/ecommerce-store).
The service is keyed on product ID, just like the database table it writes to. Restate ensures that there are never concurrent writes to the same product.
:::

:::caution
Take into account the concurrency limitations when designing your applications!
- Time-consuming operations in a keyed service, for example sleeps, lock that key/service for the entire operation.
Other invocations for that key/service are enqueued, until the invocation has completed.
- Deadlocks: Watch out for cyclical request-response calls in your application.
For example, if A calls B, and B calls C, and C calls A again.
Each service waits on the response of the other and none of them can progress.
The keys remain locked and the system can't process any more requests.
:::

## Suspendable request-response calls
:::note Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `src/part1`.
:::

One of the key parts of distributed applications is service-to-service communication.
Restate makes sure that service-to-service communication is durable.
Messages never get lost.

The tour begins with request-response calls, in which one service calls another service and waits for the response.

When the `UserSession/addTicket` function is called, it first needs to reserve the ticket for the user.
It does that by calling the `TicketService/reserve` function.
Add the highlighted code snippet to the `addTicket` function in the user session service.

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";
import { ticketServiceApi } from "./ticket_service";

const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  //highlight-start
  const success = await ctx.rpc(ticketServiceApi).reserve(ticketId);
  //highlight-end
  return success;
};
```

To do the call, you supply the exported `ticketServiceApi` to the RpcContext via the `rpc` function to specify which service to invoke.
Then you call the `reserve` function, which returns a Promise that gets resolved with the `boolean` response.

Try it out by running the services via `npm run app` and send a request to `UserSession/addTicket`, as we did [previously](#running-the-services-and-runtime).

Have a look at the SDK and runtime logs, to see how the ingress request triggers the execution of the `addTicket` and `reserve` functions.

To better understand what's going on, you can increase the log level by setting the environment variable `RESTATE_DEBUG_LOGGING=JOURNAL`.
You can silence the logging by removing this environment variable in `package.json`, where the scripts are defined.
To also log the messages, use `RESTATE_DEBUG_LOGGING=JOURNAL_VERBOSE`.

### What actually happened?
The call you just did, seems like a regular RPC call.
Under-the-hood Restate does a number of things to make sure that this call is durable.

The runtime persists the incoming request, establishes a connection to the user session service, and sends the request over that connection.
All the communication between the runtime and the service, goes over this connection.
The service itself never needs to set up the connection.

The user session service then calls the ticket service.
This request goes over the open connection to the runtime, that again durably logs it and invokes the ticket service.
The runtime takes care of request retries, in case of failures (covered later on in [Resiliency](#resiliency)).
Finally, the runtime routes the response back to the user session service.

When services need to wait a long time, for example sleep an hour, or wait for a day on a response, Restate suspends the function invocations to free up the resources for other invocations.
When the service can resume, Restate invokes the service again and sends over a replay log.
The replay log contains the steps that the service already executed before it suspended.
The service replays the log and continues processing at the point where it left off.

:::tip
The suspension mechanism of Restate is especially beneficial if you run on serverless infrastructure, for example AWS Lambda.
For example, you can do request-response calls without paying for the idle time when waiting for a response.
:::

To see this work in practice, you mimic the ticket service doing heavy processing by adding a sleep call to the `TicketService/reserve` function:

```typescript
import { setTimeout } from "timers/promises";

const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  //bad-code-start
  await setTimeout(35000);
  //bad-code-end
  return true;
};
```

:::caution
This isn't the proper way to sleep in a Restate application!
The Restate SDK offers you a way to do sleeps that are suspendable, as covered [later on](#suspendable-sleep).
:::

Call `UserSession/addTicket` again and have a look at the SDK logs.
Now that the ticket service responds after 35 seconds, you see that the `addTicket` function suspends after 30 seconds.
Once the runtime has received the response, it invokes the `addTicket` function again and the call finishes.

### 📝 Try it out
Make the `UserSession/checkout` function call the `Checkout/checkout` function.

For the request field, you can use a hard-coded string array for now: `["456"]`.
You will fix this later on.

<>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

Add the following code to the `UserSession/checkout` function:

```typescript
import { checkoutApi } from "./checkout";

const checkout = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, userId: string) => {
  //highlight-start
  const checkoutRequest = { userId: userId, tickets: ["456"] };
  const success = await ctx.rpc(checkoutApi).checkout(checkoutRequest);
  //highlight-end

  return sucess;
};
```

Call the `UserSession/checkout` function as you did earlier and have a look at the logs again to see what happened:
```log

```

Notice that the `UserSession` didn't get suspended because the response came before the suspension timeout hit.

</details>
</>

## Reliable message sending without queues

Until now, you did request-response calls and waited for the response.
You can also do one-way calls via Restate, where you don't wait for the response.
The syntax is similar.
All you need to do is to use `RpcContext.send`, as you do here in the `UserSession/addTicket` function:

```typescript
const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  // highlight-start
  ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).reserve(ticketId);
  // highlight-end
  return true;
};
```

Note that `RpcContext.send` isn't an asynchronous operation which returns a promise.
Therefore, there is no need to await it.

Once you adapted the code, try it out by calling the `UserSession/addTicket` function, as [explained earlier](#running-the-services-and-runtime).
In the service logs, you see that the `addTicket` function doesn't wait for a response and finishes earlier than the `reserve` function.

:::tip Good news!
Restate retries failed one-way invocations for you. No need to set up any message queues.

### 📝 Try it out
In this example, when you add a seat to your shopping cart, it gets reserved for 15 minutes.
When a user didn't proceed with the payment before the timeout, you need to call the `UserSession/expireTicket` function.
Let the `expireTicket` function call the `TicketService/unreserve` function.

When you are done with the implementation, send a request to `UserSession/expireTicket` to check if it works.

<>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```typescript
const expireTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  // highlight-start
  ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve(ticketId);
  // highlight-end
};
```

Call the `expireTicket` function with:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/UserSession/expireTicket \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"key": "123", "request": "456"}'
```

Have a look at the logs again to see what happened:

## Durable timers
:::note Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `src/part2`.
:::

Restate suspends a function invocation when it waits on external input.
The partial progress of the service invocation is durably stored in the log and can be resumed once the external input has arrived.
Restate offers the same mechanism for timers.

### Suspendable sleep
You can do a durable, suspendable sleep with the Typescript SDK.
Earlier in this tutorial, you explored how Restate suspensions work by letting the ticket service sleep:
```typescript
const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  //bad-code-start
  await setTimeout(35000);
  //bad-code-end
  return true;
};
```
❗ This line of code would keep the service invocation running idly, and would not survive service restarts.

To use a durable, suspendable sleep, use the sleep feature of the Restate SDK:
```typescript
const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  //good-code-start
  await ctx.sleep(35000);
  //good-code-end
  return true;
};
```

Send an `addTicket` request, as [you did earlier](#running-the-services-and-runtime).
In the service logs, you can see the `reserve` function processing the sleep, then suspending, and then resuming again after the sleep completed.
The `addTicket` function did a one-way call to the `reserve` function so didn't suspend but just finished its invocation.

```

</details>


Revert the `reserve` function call to a request-response call, to see how the suspensions work across different services.
Replace the `RpcContext.send()` with `RpcContext.rpc()`, to end up with:

```ts
const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  // highlight-start
  ctx.rpc(ticketServiceApi).reserve(ticketId);
  // highlight-end
  return true;
};
```

Now you see in the logs that both services get suspended.
The user session service gets suspended because it waits for a response from the `reserve` function and the ticket service gets suspended because it waits for the sleep to be completed.
Restate keeps track of how long the service should sleep and then triggers it to resume the invocation.
Finally, you see the responses of both functions coming in.

When you reduce the time the `TicketService/reserve` function sleeps to a second, you won't see the suspensions anymore.


:::caution
Sleeping blocks processing for keyed services (for that single key).

### Delayed calls

Take a look at a slightly different usage of timers.
In the application, a ticket gets reserved for 15 minutes.
If the user doesn't pay within that time interval, then it becomes available again to other users.

To do this, you can use a delayed call.
This is a one-way call that gets delayed by a specified duration.
This would make the `UserSession/addTicket` function look as follows:

```typescript
const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  const reservationSuccess = await ctx
    .rpc(ticketServiceApi)
    .reserve(ticketId);

  if (reservationSuccess) {
    // highlight-start
    ctx
      .sendDelayed(userSessionApi, 15 * 60 * 1000)
      .expireTicket(userId, ticketId);
    // highlight-end
  }

  return reservationSuccess;
};
```

To test it out, put the delay to a lower value, for example 5 seconds, call the `addTicket` function, and see in the logs how the call is executed 5 seconds later.

```

</details>

Don't forget to set the delay back to 15 minutes.

:::caution
You can implement this pattern in different ways.
You could also sleep for 15 minutes at the end of the `addTicket` function and then call the `TicketService/unreserve` function:

```typescript
await ctx.sleep(15 * 60 * 1000);
ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve({
  userId: userId,
  ticketId: ticketId,
});
```

Be aware that sleeping in a keyed service blocks any invocations for that key.
In this case, the user would not be able to add any other tickets, nor buy the tickets.

If you do a sleep operation, the invocation is ongoing.
If you do a delayed call, the invocation isn't ongoing until the delay has passed, so no key is locked.

:::

## Persistent application state

Applications often need to keep state. For example, the user session service
needs to track the shopping cart items.

Restate offers a key-value store to persistently store application state.

:::tip Good news!
Restate's state is guaranteed to be consistent across retries and invocations.
This eliminates the need for a session database.
:::

The isolation level of the application state depends on the service type:
1. Keyed service: Application state is isolated per key.
All the invocations for the same key have access to the same application state.
Restate's state feature is most useful for this service type.
2. Unkeyed service: State is isolated per invocation. Using state isn't useful
for this service type.

Try to adapt the `UserSession/addTicket` function to keep track of the cart items.
After reserving the product, you add the ticket to the shopping cart.
Have a look at the highlighted code:

```ts
const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string) => {

    // ... reserve call returning success ...

    if (reservationSuccess) {
        //highlight-next-line
        const tickets = (await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets")) ?? [];
        tickets.push(ticketId);
        //highlight-next-line
        ctx.set("tickets", tickets);

        // ... expireTicket call ...
    }

    return reservationSuccess;
}
```

To retrieve the cart, the first highlighted line calls `await ctx.get<T>(state_key: string)`.
This returns `null` if the value has never been set.

You can store multiple key-value pairs, by using different state keys.
Here, you get the value under the key `"tickets"`.
Restate ensures that you get the cart belonging to the current user ID (key of the service).

After you added the ticket to the cart array, the second highlighted line sets the state to the new value with `ctx.set(state_key: string, new_value: T)`.

Run the services and call the `addTicket` function, to see the interaction with state in the logs.

<details><summary>Show the logs</summary>

```log
... logs from reserve call ...
// highlight-start
[restate] [2023-08-16T07:32:02.415Z] DEBUG: [UserSession/addTicket] [K1qex52CPYkBiiHVZ9t6j52X1BcPKa1N] : Adding message to journal and sending to Restate ; GetStateEntryMessage

// highlight-end
... logs from expireTicket call ...
```

</details>

You see that when you request the state, it gets logged in the journal.
The state value gets immediately retrieved, because the invocation state is eagerly sent.
Finally, you set the new value.

Add a log statement to print the cart contents, and then call `addTicket` multiple times to see how the state gets updated:

```ts
console.info(`Current tickets: ${JSON.stringify(tickets)}`);
```

You can also stop and relaunch the service or restart the runtime (`docker restart restate_dev`), to see that this has no influence on the tickets.

:::info
You can store any object in the state as long as the value can be serialized with `Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`.
:::

Try to also adapt the `checkout` function in the user session service, to use the tickets:
```typescript
const checkout = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, userId: string) => {
  // 1. Retrieve the tickets from state
  //highlight-next-line
  const tickets = (await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets")) ?? [];

  // 2. If there are no tickets, return `false`
  //highlight-start
  if (tickets.length === 0) {
    return false;
  }
  //highlight-end

  // 3. Call the `checkout` function of the checkout service with the tickets
  const checkoutSuccess = await ctx
    .rpc(checkoutApi)
    .checkout({ userId: userId, tickets: tickets });

  // 4. If this was successful, empty the tickets.
  // Otherwise, let the user try again.
  if (checkoutSuccess) {
    // highlight-next-line
    ctx.clear("tickets");
  }

  return checkoutSuccess;
};
```

Have a look at the logs to see how the code executes the workflow.

### 📝 Try it out
#### Finishing `UserSession/expireTicket`

You almost fully implemented the user session service.
Now that you implemented the checkout function, you can also finish the `UserSession/expireTicket`.

At the moment you have the following code:

```ts
const expireTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve(ticketId);
};
```

Before you call `unreserve`, you first need to check if the ticket is still hold by the user.
Retrieve the state and check if the ticket ID is in there.
If this is the case, then you call `TicketService/unreserve` and remove it from the state.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```ts
const expireTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  const tickets = (await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets")) ?? [];

  const ticketIndex = tickets.findIndex(ticket => ticket === ticketId);

  if (ticketIndex != -1) {
    tickets.splice(ticketIndex, 1);
    ctx.set("tickets", tickets);

    ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve(ticketId);
  }
};
```

</details>


#### Implementing the ticket service
You can track the status of the tickets in the ticket service by storing it in the state.

1. Implement the `TicketService/reserve` function.
The function first retrieves the value for the `"status"` state key.
If the value is set to `TicketStatus.Available`, then change it to `TicketStatus.Reserved"` and
return `true` (reservation successful).
If the status isn't set to `TicketStatus.Available`, then return `false`.
Remove the sleep that you added before.

<>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```ts
const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  const status =
    (await ctx.get<TicketStatus>("status")) ?? TicketStatus.Available;

  if (status === TicketStatus.Available) {
    ctx.set("status", TicketStatus.Reserved);
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

Now, you can't reserve the same ticket multiple times anymore.
Call `addTicket` multiple times for the same ID. The first time it returns `true`, afterwards `false`.
</details>
</>

2. Implement the `TicketService/unreserve` function.
The function should set the value of the `"status"` key to `TicketStatus.Available` if it's reserved.

<>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```ts
const unreserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  const status =
    (await ctx.get<TicketStatus>("status")) ?? TicketStatus.Available;

  if (status === TicketStatus.Sold) {
    return false;
  } else {
    ctx.clear("status");
    return true;
  }
};
```

Now, the ticket reservation status switches back to `TicketStatus.Available` when the delayed call triggers.
Play around with reducing the delay of the `expireTicket` call in the `addTicket` function.
Try to reserve the same ticket ID multiple times, and see how you are able to reserve it again after the `unreserve` function executed.

</details>
</>

3. Implement the `TicketService/markAsSold` function.
The function should set the value of the `"status"` key to `TicketStatus.Sold` if it's reserved.
If successful, the function returns `true`.


<>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```ts
const markAsSold = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  const status =
    (await ctx.get<TicketStatus>("status")) ?? TicketStatus.Available;

  if (status === TicketStatus.Reserved) {
    ctx.set("status", TicketStatus.Sold);
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

In the next section, you implement the `Checkout/checkout` function that calls `markAsSold`.
This ties the final parts together.

## Side effects

:::note Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `src/part3`.
:::

Restate's replay mechanism makes applications resilient to failures.
It only requires your code to be deterministic.

If you need to execute a non-deterministic code snippet, for example generating a UUID or communicating to an external system, then you should wrap it in a side effect.
The side effect executes the supplied function and eagerly stores the return value in Restate.
Upon replay, the stored value gets inserted and the function doesn't get re-executed.

:::tip
You can use a side effect to avoid re-execution during replay for any arbitrary piece of user code.
This includes pieces of time-consuming, deterministic user code.
:::

Use a side effect in `Checkout/checkout` to create and store a UUID (with the [uuid library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)) or idempotency key:

```typescript
import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

const checkout = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  request: { userId: string; tickets: string[] },
) => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const idempotencyKey = await ctx.sideEffect<string>(async () => uuid());
  return true;
};
```

The highlighted line of code wraps the creation of the UUID in a side effect with a string return type.
When the `checkout()` function gets re-executed upon replay, Restate injects the stored value.

To experiment, you can add a log line and a sleep to see how the UUID gets replayed after the suspension:

```ts
console.log("My idempotency key: " + idempotencyKey);
await ctx.sleep(31000);
```

Have a look at the logs to see what happens.

Remove the sleep again, before you continue.

:::caution
You can't execute any RestateContext calls from within a side effect.
This is invalid code.
:::

### 📝 Try it out
#### Executing the payment
The `checkout` function triggers the payment via some external payment provider (`PaymentClient`). You can find a payment client stub in `src/aux/payment_client.ts`.
The payment client has two methods:

- `get()` to create a new client,
- `call(idempotencyKey: string, amount: number)` to execute the payment for a certain idempotency key and total amount.
The payment provider makes sure that exactly one payment gets processed for a single idempotency key.

Create a new payment client in `CheckoutService/Checkout`.
Assume every ticket costs 40 dollars.
Then execute the payment with the created idempotency key and store the boolean result of the call as a side effect.
Also use the boolean result for the return value of the function.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```typescript
const checkout = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  request: { userId: string; tickets: string[] },
) => {
  const idempotencyKey = await ctx.sideEffect<string>(async () => uuid());

  const totalPrice = request.tickets.length * 40;

  // highligh-start
  const paymentClient = PaymentClient.get();
  const success = paymentClient.call(idempotencyKey, totalPrice);
  // highlight-end

  return success;
};
```

Add some tickets to your cart and then call `UserSession/checkout`.
You should see similar logs:

```

You see the `UserSession` service retrieving the cart and calling the checkout service.
The `Checkout` service then does a side effect, the payment, and another side effect.
The checkout success is propagated back to the `UserSession` service.

</details>

#### Finishing the checkout workflow
Once this works, you implement the rest of the checkout workflow:
- If the payment call was successful, then:
    - use the EmailClient in `src/aux/email_client.ts` to notify the users of the payment success.
    Prevent duplicate emails during retries by using a side effect.
    - let the calling `UserSession` mark all tickets as sold via `TicketService/markAsSold`.
- If the payment call was unsuccessful, then:
    - use the EmailClient in `src/aux/email_client.ts` to notify the users of the payment failure.
    Prevent duplicate emails during retries by using a side effect.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

The `Checkout/checkout` function looks now the following:

```ts
const checkout = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  request: { userId: string; tickets: string[] },
) => {
  const idempotencyKey = await ctx.sideEffect(async () => uuid());

  const totalPrice = request.tickets.length * 40;

  const paymentClient = PaymentClient.get();

  const success = await paymentClient.call(idempotencyKey, totalPrice);

  const email = EmailClient.get();

  if (success) {
    console.info("Payment successful. Notifying user about shipment.");
    await ctx.sideEffect(async () =>
      email.notifyUserOfPaymentSuccess(request.userId),
    );
  } else {
    console.info("Payment failure. Notifying user about it.");
    await ctx.sideEffect(async () =>
      email.notifyUserOfPaymentFailure(request.userId),
    );
  }

  return success;
};
```

The `UserSession/checkout` function looks now the following:

```ts
const checkout = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, userId: string) => {
  const tickets = await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets");

  if (tickets && tickets.length > 0) {
    const checkout_success = await ctx
      .rpc(checkoutApi)
      .checkout({ userId: userId, tickets: tickets! });

    if (checkout_success) {
      for (const ticket_id of tickets) {
        ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).markAsSold(ticket_id);
      }
      ctx.clear("tickets");
    }

    return checkout_success;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

</details>


🥳 Except for a few resiliency tweaks, you fully implemented the ticket reservation system!

:::info
🚩 Explore the intermediate solution in `src/part3`, and run it with `npm run part3`.
:::
## Resiliency

:::note Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `src/part4`.
:::

As you have discovered throughout this tutorial, Restate makes your applications resilient out-of-the-box by:

- Making sure messages can't get lost by durably storing all calls in the log.
No more queues needed for asynchronous calls.
- Retrying failed invocations.
No more retry logic required for inter-service communication.
- Restoring partial progress of invocations, via its durable execution mechanism.
For example, if a service goes down due to an infrastructure failure, the ongoing invocations resume at the point in the user code where they left off.
- Ensuring consistent application state with its key-value store.
- Providing end-to-end exactly-once guarantees for incoming invocations.

:::tip Good news!
These features are switched on by default. No need to do anything.
:::

### Side effect retries

If you do a side effect operation and the side effect fails, then it is retried until it succeeds.
You can observe this behavior by using the `paymendClient.failingCall` in `Checkout/checkout`:

```typescript
const paymentClient = PaymentClient.get();
//highlight-start
const doPayment = async () => paymentClient.failingCall(idempotencyKey, amount)
const success = await ctx.sideEffect(doPayment);
//highlight-end
```

You now call `paymentClient.failingCall` which fails 2 times before succeeding.
A failing side effect is retried with an exponential backoff until it succeeds.
Restate uses suspending sleeps for the wait time between retries.
Have a look at the logs to see the retries.

## Tracing
Restate exposes OpenTelemetry traces of your invocations.

Run the Jaeger container with:
```shell
docker run -d --name jaeger \
-e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
-p 4317:4317 \
-p 16686:16686 \
jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.46
```

Then restart the runtime with the tracing endpoint defined as an environment variable:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -e RESTATE_OBSERVABILITY__TRACING__ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 --network=host ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -e RESTATE_OBSERVABILITY__TRACING__ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:4317 -p 8081:8081 -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 5432:5432 ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Go to the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686.

Send requests to the runtime by adding tickets and checking out.

In the Jaeger UI, select the `UserSession` service from the service dropdown.
You should see the `addTicket` and `checkout` requests listed:

![Jaeger traces tour](/img/jaeger_traces_tour_handler.png)

Have a look at the traces of the `checkout` call:

![Checkout call traces](/img/jaeger_checkout_traces_tour_handler.png)

You can see the calls that were done to Restate, for example invoke, sleep, one way call, get state, etc., and their timings.
If you expand one of the traces, you can see tags describing some metadata of the context call, for example invocation id and call arguments.


You can use Jaeger's search feature to find specific traces.
For example, to find the traces of a specific invocation, you can enter the Restate invocation ID, which you can find in the logs, into the search field `Tags`:
```
restate.invocation.id="T4pIkIJIGAsBiiGDV2dxK7PkkKnWyWHE"
```
![Checkout call search](/img/jaeger_invocationid_search_handler.png)

Or for example, to search all traces of `checkout` calls, you can select `invoke checkout` in the `Operation` dropdown.

Note that one-way calls are shown as separate traces.
The traces of the original call contain the one-way call, but the timing represents only the scheduling of the one-way call in the runtime.
To search for the traces of the execution of the one-way call, you can use the `restate.invocation.id`:

![Jaeger background call](/img/jaeger_tour_background_call_handler.png)

For more information, have a look at the [tracing docs](/restate/tracing).

## 🏁 The end
You reached the end of this tutorial!

:::info 🚩 Have a look at the fully implemented app in `src/part4`, and run it with `npm run part4`.
:::

Let's recap what you've covered:
- reliable, suspendable request-response calls
- one-way calls without the need for queues
- suspensions for external communication
- durable timers for sleep or for calling other services
- concurrency guarantees for keyed/unkeyed services
- persistent application state
- storing the results of non-deterministic operations or external calls as side effects
- resiliency and retries
- tracing with Jaeger

## Next steps
This tutorial didn't cover anything related to deployment.
In this tutorial, you ran the services as long-running services in Docker containers.
Restate services can run with minimal changes on AWS Lambda as well.

Possible next step:
- [Run the examples](/examples)
