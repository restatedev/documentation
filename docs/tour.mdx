# Tour of Restate

This tutorial guides you through the development of an end-to-end Restate application, and covers all the essential features.
After this tutorial, you should have a firm understanding of how Restate can help you and feel comfortable to tackle your next application on your own.

This tutorial implements a ticket reservation application for a theatre.
It allows users to add tickets for specific seats to their shopping cart.
After the user adds a ticket, the seat gets reserved for 15 minutes.
If the user doesn't pay for the ticket within that time interval, the reservation is released and the ticket becomes available to other users.

Restate applications are made up of services that expose methods to each other and the outside world. Services communicate with one another using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Our ticket example consists of three services having the following responsibilities:

1. **User session**: keeps track of the tickets in the shopping cart.
2. **Ticket service**: manages the ticket allocation.
3. **Checkout**: handles the checkout process of the ticket sale.

As we go, you will discover how Restate can help you with some intricacies in this application.

## Getting started

### Setting up the tutorial

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

Clone the GitHub repository of the [tutorial](https://github.com/restatedev/tour-of-restate):

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch vVAR::TOUR_VERSION git@github.com:restatedev/tour-of-restate.git && cd tour-of-restate/typescript
```

This GitHub repository contains the basic skeleton of the NodeJS/TypeScript services that you develop in this tutorial.

First, get all dependencies and build tools. Then build the app:
```shell
npm install && npm run build
```

Clone the GitHub repository of the [tutorial](https://github.com/restatedev/tour-of-restate):
```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch vVAR::TOUR_VERSION git@github.com:restatedev/tour-of-restate.git && cd tour-of-restate/java
```

This GitHub repository contains the basic skeleton of the Java services that you develop in this tutorial.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Starting the components

Let's start a basic version of the Restate services that we will be using for this tour. This is where our application logic will reside.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```shell
npm run app
```

You can run the solution of a specific part by running, for example for part 2:

```shell
npm run part2
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```shell
./gradlew run
```

If you do not want to follow along by coding yourself, you can run the solution of a specific part by running, for example for part 2:

```shell
./gradlew -PmainClass=dev.restate.tour.part2.AppMain run
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, let's launch Restate itself. Restate can be deployed as a simple standalone binary, all the way up to a fully managed service. In this tour we'll be running it standalone from a container image.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d --network=host docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```shell
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9070-9072:9070-9072 docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you are finished with the tour, you can stop Restate with `docker stop restate_dev`. This also deletes any persisted state because we start the container with the `--rm` flag. You can restart Restate at a later time (without losing state) with `docker restart restate_dev`. You can view Restate logs using `docker logs restate_dev` or follow them live by adding `--follow`.

### Registering services with Restate

When Restate first comes up, it doesn't know anything about our services. Let's tell it where they are running. You can trigger service discovery by calling the Restate admin API informing it about the service deployment where our service is listening.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

You do this by sending a request to the Restate endpoint at `http://localhost:9070/deployments`
and providing it with the service deployment URL `http://host.docker.internal:9080`.

```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:9080"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Restate will send a discovery request to the service deployment to find the services and methods run behind this endpoint. Restate keeps track of which services run where (including of the method signatures). Restate also keeps track of multiple revisions as your APIs evolve, and routes requests appropriately.

:::tip
You can pipe the output of `curl` into the `jq` utility to reformat the JSON output and make it easier to read.
:::

You should now see the registered services printed out to your terminal:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```json

      /* ... Additional information on registered methods ...*/
    },
    {
      "name": "UserSession",
      "revision": 1
      /* ... Additional information on registered methods ...*/
    },
    {
      "name": "Checkout",
      "revision": 1
      /* ... Additional information on registered methods ...*/
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```json
{
    "id": "bG9jYWxob3N0OjgwODAv",
    "services": [
        {
            "name": "example.TicketService",
            "revision": 1
            /* ... Additional information on registered methods ...*/
        },
        {
            "name": "example.UserSession",
            "revision": 1
            /* ... Additional information on registered methods ...*/
        },
        {
            "name": "example.Checkout",
            "revision": 1
            /* ... Additional information on registered methods ...*/
        }
    ]
}
```

</TabItem>

### Calling services from outside Restate

Add a ticket to a cart by calling `UserSession/addTicket`.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```shell
curl localhost:8080/UserSession/addTicket \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"key": "123", "request": "456"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```shell
curl localhost:8080/example.UserSession/AddTicket \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"user_id": "123", "ticket_id": "456"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If this prints out `true`, then you have a working setup.

You can call the `UserSession/checkout` function to proceed with the purchase, as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```shell
curl localhost:8080/UserSession/checkout \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"key": "123"}'
```

In `src/app` you will find the skeletons of the various services to help you start implementing the app. The `app.ts` file contains the definition of the server that hosts the set of services.

:::tip
Only public Restate services are callable from outside Restate using the ingress endpoint. [You can mark services as private](https://docs.restate.dev/services/invocation#private-services) which makes them available only to other Restate services.
:::

## Services and concurrency

Restate supports three distinct kinds of services:

1. **Keyed service**:
All service invocations are sharded on a user-defined key.
Function invocations of keyed services are serialized on the user-defined key.
Therefore, at most one function can run at a time for a given key within such service.
2. **Unkeyed service**:
No key defined.
No concurrency guarantees or limitations.
Invocations are processed as they come in.
You would get the same behavior with a keyed service with random keys.
3. **Singleton service** (not available for TypeScript Handler API): No key defined. There is at most one concurrent invocation for this entire service. You can
see this as a keyed service where all invocations have an identical key. This service type does not scale up, so
don't use it for heavy load.

In this example app, the `Checkout` service is an unkeyed service, while the `TicketService` and `UserSession` services are keyed services.
The `TicketService` is keyed by the ticket ID, while the `UserSession` service is keyed by the user ID.
So at most one invocation can run at a time for the same ticket ID or user ID respectively.

### Specifying the service type

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

**Specifying unkeyed services**

You specify an unkeyed service by creating a router with its set of functions.

```typescript
const serviceRouter = restate.router({
    hello: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, request: Request) => { ... },
    callMe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => { ... },
    maybe: async () => { ... }
});
```

The functions of an unkeyed router have two optional parameters:

* A `ctx` of type `restate.RpcContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
* A `request` of type JSON object which represents additional invocation data.

You can choose the parameter names differently.

For example, for the `Checkout` service, you create a router with the `checkout` function:

```typescript
const checkout = async (
    ctx: restate.RpcContext,
    request: { userId: string; tickets: string[] },
) => {
    return true;
};

export const checkoutRouter = restate.router({
    checkout,
    // ... optional other functions ...
});
```

The `Checkout` service only has a single function, but you can add more functions to the router if you want.

**Specifying keyed services**

You specify a keyed service by creating a keyed router with its set of functions:

```typescript
const keyedServiceRouter = restate.keyedRouter({
  hello: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, key: string, request: Request) => { ... },
  callMe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, key: string) => { ... },
  maybe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => { ... },
  withSomething: async () => { ... }
});
```

The functions of a keyed router have three optional parameters

* A `ctx` of type `restate.RpcContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
* A `key` parameter of type string which represents the key of the invoked service.
* A `request` parameter of type JSON object which represents additional invocation data.

You can choose the parameter names differently.

For example, the `UserSession` service has the following keyed router:

```typescript
export const userSessionRouter = restate.keyedRouter({ addTicket, expireTicket, checkout });
```

As mentioned, for keyed services there can be at most one concurrent invocation to any method of the service.
This means that for the same value of `key`, an unfinished call to `addTicket()` will block subsequent calls to `expireTicket()` or `checkout()` until `addTicket()` has finished. This holds true even if you omit the `key` parameter from the function signature, as we have done with the `maybe()` and `withSomething()` functions above.

**Exporting the service API**

You export the `service` API by creating a service API instance which specifies under which path the service is reachable.

For example, for the `UserSession` service, you export the following service API:

```typescript
export const userSessionApi: restate.ServiceApi<typeof userSessionRouter> = {
    path: "UserSession",
};
```

You can now call the service at the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/<servicePath>/<functionName>`.
For example, you call the `addTicket` function of the `UserSession` service at `http://localhost:8080/UserSession/addTicket`, as you did earlier.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

Restate uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) to specify the service methods.
That's also where you define the service type and key.
Have a look at the Protobuf definitions of the ticket service of our example in `src/main/proto/tour.proto`:
```protobuf
service TicketService {
    //highlight-next-line
    option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

    rpc Reserve (Ticket) returns (google.protobuf.BoolValue);
    //... other methods...
}

message Ticket {
    //highlight-next-line
    string ticket_id = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];
}
```

The first highlighted line of the service definition defines the type of Restate service.
The ticket service is a keyed service. For unkeyed or singleton services, use `UNKEYED` and `SINGLETON` respectively.

For keyed services, you need to tag one of the fields of the input request as the key
by adding the `[(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY]` annotation,
as done the second highlighted line.
Make sure that you define the key field for all the methods of a keyed service.
The key field must be of type `string`.

Besides these tags, there is nothing Restate-specific about the Protobuf definitions.
To learn more about gRPC, have a look at the [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The concurrency guarantees of keyed services make it a lot easier to reason about interaction with external systems.

Imagine you have a keyed service which is the single writer to a database and every key only interacts with an isolated set of database rows.
Then you can scale your application and never have concurrent invocations writing to the same database row.
This resolves common data consistency issues such as lost updates or non-repeatable reads.

Have a look at the product service of the [shopping cart example](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/typescript/ecommerce-store).
The service is keyed on product ID, just like the database table it writes to. Restate ensures that there are never concurrent writes to the same product.
:::

:::caution
Take into account the concurrency limitations when designing your applications!
- Time-consuming operations in a keyed service, for example sleeps, lock that key/service for the entire operation.
Other invocations for that key/service are enqueued, until the invocation has completed.
- Deadlocks: Watch out for cyclical request-response calls in your application.
For example, if A calls B, and B calls C, and C calls A again.
Each service waits on the response of the other and none of them can progress.
The keys remain locked and the system can't process any more requests.
:::

## Service calls

:::note
Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `part1`.
:::

One of the key parts of distributed applications is service-to-service communication. Service method calls are implemented as RPC messages. Restate makes service-to-service communication reliable by ensuring that messages do not get lost.

### Calling services within Restate

The tour begins with an introduction to request-response calls, in which one service calls another service and waits for the response.

When the `UserSession/addTicket` function is called, it first needs to reserve the ticket for the user.
It does that by calling the `TicketService/reserve` function.
Add the highlighted code snippet to the `addTicket` function in the `UserSession` service.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";
import { ticketServiceApi } from "./ticket_service";

const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  //highlight-next-line
  const success = await ctx.rpc(ticketServiceApi).reserve(ticketId);
  return success;
};
```

To make the call, you supply the exported `ticketServiceApi` to the RpcContext via the `rpc` function to specify which service to invoke.
Then you call the `reserve` function, which returns a Promise that gets resolved with the `boolean` response.

Try it out by running the services via `npm run app` and send a request to `UserSession/addTicket`, as we did [previously](#calling-services-from-outside-restate).

Have a look at the SDK and runtime logs, to see how the ingress request triggers the execution of the `addTicket` and `reserve` functions.

To better understand what's going on, you can increase the log level by setting the environment variable `RESTATE_DEBUG_LOGGING=JOURNAL`.
You can silence the logging by removing this environment variable in `package.json`, where the scripts are defined.
To also log the messages, use `RESTATE_DEBUG_LOGGING=JOURNAL_VERBOSE`.

```java
@Override
public BoolValue addTicket(RestateContext ctx, ReserveTicket request) throws TerminalException {

```

The simplest way to make a call within Restate is to use the generated client. Use `.await()` to wait for the response to the call.

Try it out by running the services via `./gradlew run` and send a request to `example.UserSession/AddTicket`, as we did [previously](#calling-services-from-outside-restate).

The call you just added seems like a regular RPC call that you might be familiar with from other service frameworks. This similarity is superficial; under the hood the Restate runtime and SDK cooperate to deliver resiliency and efficiency.

When an incoming request is sent to Restate, the runtime first persists it. It establishes a connection to the user session service, and sends the request over to begin a new invocation. All communications between the service and other Restate components goes over this connection. In particular, the user session service does not communicate directly with the ticket service.

When the user session service makes an RPC to the ticket service, this request goes over the open connection to the runtime. Once again, this is durably persisted in the Restate journal, before it is passed on (by Restate) to the ticket service. In case of a failure, Restate takes care of retrying according to the configured policy. We will cover [Resiliency](#resiliency) in more detail later on. When the ticket service responds, its response is then sent back to the runtime, which persists it and forwards it to the user session service to continue execution.

When services take a while to respond, Restate suspends the calling execution to free up the resources for other invocations. When the calling service is unblocked to resume, Restate invokes it again and sends over a replay log. This replay log contains all the state that the previously completed steps generated prior to suspension. The service replays the log, and the service resumes execution from the point where it left off prior to suspending.

:::tip
The suspension mechanism is especially beneficial if you deploy your services to a FaaS platform such as AWS Lambda. This way you don't pay for the idle time a caller spends waiting for a response when making synchronous service calls within Restate!
:::

### Waiting for slow services

To see this work in practice, let's pretend that ticket reservations take a while by making the `TicketService/reserve` function sleep for a while.

:::caution
This is not the best way to sleep in a Restate service! The Restate SDK offers a native way to suspend execution for a period of time. We will cover [suspendable sleep a bit later on](#suspendable-sleep) in the tour.

```typescript
import { setTimeout } from "timers/promises";

const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  //bad-code-start
  await setTimeout(35000);
  //bad-code-end
  return true;
};

```

Call `UserSession/addTicket` again and have a look at the SDK logs.
Now that the ticket service responds after 35 seconds, you see that the `addTicket` function suspends after 30 seconds.
Once the runtime has received the response, it invokes the `addTicket` function again and the original call finishes.

:::tip Terminating invocations
[By default](https://docs.restate.dev/restate/configuration/#default-configuration) Restate will keep retrying failed invocations until they succeed. If at any point during testing you create an invocation that you want to permanently terminate, you can kill it using the [Admin API](https://docs.restate.dev/references/admin-api#tag/invocation) and the invocation id from the logs:

```shell
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9070/invocations/<invocation_id>
```

Each invocation gets an ID assigned by Restate. You can find the ID printed in the service logs.

## Reliable message sending without queues

Up to now, all our service calls waited for a response. This is referred to as request-response or synchronous RPC. With Restate, you can also make one-way calls where you don't wait for the response.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

Update `expireTicket` to use `RpcContext.send` to send a one-way message to release the reservation:

```typescript
const addTicket = async (
    ctx: restate.RpcContext,
    userId: string,
    ticketId: string,
) => {
    // highlight-start
    ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).reserve(ticketId);
    // highlight-end
    return true;
};
```

Note that `RpcContext.send` isn't an asynchronous operation which returns a promise.
Therefore, there is no need to await it.

Once you have adapted the code, try it out by calling the `UserSession/addTicket` function, as [explained earlier](#calling-services-from-outside-restate).
In the service logs, you see that the `addTicket` function doesn't wait for a response and finishes earlier than the `reserve` function.

### 📝 Try it out

In this example, when you add a seat to your shopping cart, it gets reserved for 15 minutes.
When a user didn't proceed with the payment before the timeout, you need to call the `UserSession/expireTicket` function.
Let the `expireTicket` function call the `TicketService/unreserve` function.

When you are done with the implementation, send a request to `UserSession/expireTicket` to check if it works.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```typescript
const expireTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  // highlight-start
  ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve(ticketId);
  // highlight-end
};
```

Call the `expireTicket` function with:
```shell
curl localhost:8080/UserSession/expireTicket \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"key": "123", "request": "456"}'

## Durable timers

:::note
Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `part2`.
:::

Restate suspends a function invocation when it waits on external input.
The partial progress of the service invocation is durably stored in the log and can be resumed once the external input has arrived.
Restate offers the same mechanism for timers.

### Suspendable sleep

[Earlier in this tutorial](#waiting-for-slow-services), you saw how Restate caller suspension works when you make an RPC request to another service. We artificially slowed down the target service by using platform-native sleep. Sometimes you intentionally want to suspend execution for a period of time, for example to back off from overloading a dependency or simply you are implementing a long-running business workflow. In those situations you can explicitly suspend execution for arbitrarily long periods of time using the Restate context's `sleep` function. Adapt the `TicketService/reserve` function to use `ctx.sleep`:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  //good-code-start
  await ctx.sleep(35000);
  //good-code-end
  return true;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Override
public BoolValue reserve(RestateContext ctx, Ticket request) throws TerminalException {
    //good-code-start
    ctx.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(65));
    //good-code-end

    return BoolValue.of(true);
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Send an `addTicket` request, as [you did earlier](#running-the-services-and-runtime).
In the service logs, you can see the `reserve` function processing the sleep, then suspending, and then resuming again after the sleep completed.
The `addTicket` function did a one-way call to the `reserve` function so didn't suspend but just finished its invocation.

You see the invocation suspending after 60 seconds. And being re-invoked 5 seconds later when the sleep is complete.

Now you see in the logs that both services get suspended.
The user session service gets suspended because it waits for a response from the `reserve` function and the ticket service gets suspended because it waits for the sleep to be completed.
Restate keeps track of how long the service should sleep and then triggers it to resume the invocation.
Finally, you see the responses of both functions coming in.

Reduce the time the `TicketService/reserve` function sleeps to a second, so you won't see the suspensions anymore.

:::caution
In keyed or singleton services, sleeping blocks all further processing (for the specific single key / all invocations, respectively).

### Delayed calls

Take a look at a slightly different usage of timers.
In the application, a ticket gets reserved for 15 minutes.
If the user doesn't pay within that time interval, then it becomes available again to other users.

To do this, you can use a delayed call.
This is a one-way call that gets delayed by a specified duration.
This would make the `UserSession/addTicket` function look as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  const reservationSuccess = await ctx
    .rpc(ticketServiceApi)
    .reserve(ticketId);

  if (reservationSuccess) {
    // highlight-start
    ctx

Don't forget to set the delay back to 15 minutes.

:::caution
You can implement this pattern in different ways.
You could also sleep for 15 minutes at the end of the `addTicket` function and then call the `TicketService/unreserve` function:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
await ctx.sleep(15 * 60 * 1000);
ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve({
  userId: userId,
  ticketId: ticketId,
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
ctx.sleep(Duration.ofMinutes(15));
var ticketClnt = TicketServiceRestate.newClient(ctx);
ticketClnt.oneWay().unreserve(Ticket.newBuilder().setTicketId(request.getTicketId()).build());
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Be aware that sleeping in a keyed service blocks any invocations for that key.
In this case, the user would not be able to add any other tickets, nor buy the tickets.

If you do a sleep operation, the invocation is ongoing.
If you do a delayed call, the invocation isn't ongoing until the delay has passed, so no key is locked.

:::

## Persistent application state

Applications often need to keep state. For example, the user session service
needs to track the shopping cart items.

Restate offers a key-value store to persistently store application state.

:::tip Good news!
Restate's state is guaranteed to be consistent across retries and invocations.
This eliminates the need for a session database.
:::

The isolation level of the application state depends on the service type:
1. Keyed service: Application state is isolated per key.
All the invocations for the same key have access to the same application state.
Restate's state feature is most useful for this service type.
2. Unkeyed service: State is isolated per invocation. Using state isn't useful
for this service type.

### Getting and setting K/V state

Adapt the `UserSession/addTicket` function to keep track of the cart items.
After reserving the product, you add the ticket to the shopping cart.
Have a look at the highlighted code:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const addTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string) => {

    // ... reserve call returning success ...

    if (reservationSuccess) {
      //highlight-next-line
      const tickets = (await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets")) ?? [];
      tickets.push(ticketId);
      //highlight-next-line
      ctx.set("tickets", tickets);

      // ... expireTicket call ...
    }

    return reservationSuccess;
}
```

To retrieve the cart, you use `ctx.get`.
This returns `null` if the value has never been set.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// At the top of the class, define the state key: supply a name and (de)serializer
//highlight-start
public static final StateKey<Set<String>> STATE_KEY =
    StateKey.of("tickets", JacksonSerdes.of(new TypeReference<>() {}));
//highlight-end

@Override
public BoolValue addTicket(RestateContext ctx, ReserveTicket request) throws TerminalException {
    var ticketClnt = TicketServiceRestate.newClient(ctx);
    var reservationSuccess = ticketClnt
        .reserve(Ticket.newBuilder().setTicketId(request.getTicketId()).build())
        .await();

    if (reservationSuccess.getValue()) {
        // Retrieve the state
        //highlight-next-line
        var tickets = ctx.get(STATE_KEY).orElseGet(HashSet::new);
        tickets.add(request.getTicketId());
        // Set the state to the new value
        //highlight-next-line
        ctx.set(STATE_KEY, tickets);

        var userSessionClnt = UserSessionRestate.newClient(ctx);
        userSessionClnt.delayed(Duration.ofMinutes(15)).expireTicket(
            ExpireTicketRequest.newBuilder().setTicketId(request.getTicketId()).setUserId(request.getUserId()).build()
        );
    }

    return reservationSuccess;
}
```

To retrieve the cart, you use `ctx.get` with a state key that describes the name and the (de)serializers to be used.
Have a look at the documentation on serialization to learn more about the different serializers.

`ctx.get` returns an Optional, only containing a value if one was set before.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can store multiple key-value pairs, by using different state keys.
Here, you get the value under the key `"tickets"`.
Restate ensures that you get the cart belonging to the current user ID (key of the service).

After you added the ticket to the cart array, you set the state to the new value with `ctx.set`.

Run the services and call the `addTicket` function, to see the interaction with state.

You see that when you request the state, it gets logged in the journal.

When starting the invocation, Restate attaches the application state to the request.
So when you operate on the state in your function with `ctx.get` and `ctx.set`, you get access to a local copy of the state for fast access.

### Inspecting K/V state

Restate exposes information on invocations and application state via its Introspection SQL API. You can use this to gain insight into the status of invocations and the service state that is stored.
You can inspect the application state of the `UserSession` service by using psql, as follows:

```shell
psql -h localhost -p 9071 -c "SELECT * FROM state WHERE service like '%UserSession%';"
```

Or watch how the state changes with:

```shell
watch -n 1 'psql -h localhost -p 9071 -c "SELECT * FROM state WHERE service like '\''%UserSession%'\''";'
```

Add several tickets to the state to see how the query result gets updated.

You can also stop and relaunch the service or restart the runtime (`docker restart restate_dev`), to see that this has no influence on the tickets.

Also adapt the `UserSession/checkout` function, to use the tickets:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const checkout = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, userId: string) => {
  // 1. Retrieve the tickets from state
  //highlight-next-line
  const tickets = (await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets")) ?? [];

  // 2. If there are no tickets, return `false`
  //highlight-start
  if (tickets.length === 0) {
    return false;
  }
  //highlight-end

  // 3. Call the `checkout` function of the checkout service with the tickets
  const checkoutSuccess = await ctx
    .rpc(checkoutApi)
    .checkout({ userId: userId, tickets: tickets });

  // 4. If this was successful, empty the tickets.
  // Otherwise, let the user try again.
  if (checkoutSuccess) {
    // highlight-next-line
    ctx.clear("tickets");
  }

  return checkoutSuccess;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// Add to top of class
//highlight-next-line
public static final StateKey<Set<String>> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("tickets", JacksonSerdes.of(new TypeReference<>() {}));

@Override
public BoolValue checkout(RestateContext ctx, CheckoutRequest request) throws TerminalException {
    // 1. Retrieve the tickets from state
    //highlight-next-line
    var tickets = ctx.get(STATE_KEY).orElseGet(HashSet::new);

    // 2. If there are no tickets, return `false`
    //highlight-start
    if (tickets.isEmpty()) {
        return BoolValue.of(false);
    }
    //highlight-end

    // 3. Call the `checkout` function of the checkout service with the tickets
    var checkoutClnt = CheckoutRestate.newClient(ctx);
    var checkoutSuccess = checkoutClnt.checkout(
        Tour.CheckoutFlowRequest.newBuilder().setUserId(request.getUserId()).addAllTickets(tickets).build()
    ).await();

    // 4. If this was successful, empty the tickets.
    // Otherwise, let the user try again.
    if (checkoutSuccess.getValue()) {
    //highlight-next-line
        ctx.clear(STATE_KEY);
    }

    return checkoutSuccess;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the tickets are checked out, you clear the state with `ctx.clear`.
Send a checkout request as [earlier](#calling-services-from-outside-restate), and check via psql that the state is empty.

:::tip
Have a look at the documentation on [introspection](/services/introspection/) to learn more about inspecting the invocation status and application state.

#### Finishing `UserSession/expireTicket`

You have almost fully implemented the user session service. After checkout, let's finish `UserSession/expireTicket`. At the moment you have the following code:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const expireTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve(ticketId);
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Override
public void expireTicket(RestateContext ctx, ExpireTicketRequest request) throws TerminalException {
    var ticketClnt = TicketServiceRestate.newClient(ctx);
    ticketClnt.oneWay().unreserve(Ticket.newBuilder().setTicketId(request.getTicketId()).build());
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Before you call `unreserve`, you first need to check if the ticket is still hold by the user.
Retrieve the state and check if the ticket ID is in there.
If this is the case, then you call `TicketService/unreserve` and remove it from the state.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const expireTicket = async (
  ctx: restate.RpcContext,
  userId: string,
  ticketId: string,
) => {
  const tickets = (await ctx.get<string[]>("tickets")) ?? [];

  const ticketIndex = tickets.findIndex(ticket => ticket === ticketId);

  if (ticketIndex != -1) {
    tickets.splice(ticketIndex, 1);
    ctx.set("tickets", tickets);

    ctx.send(ticketServiceApi).unreserve(ticketId);
  }
};
```


Call the `expireTicket` function with:
```shell
curl localhost:8080/UserSession/expireTicket \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{"key": "123", "request": "456"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

  var tickets = ctx.get(STATE_KEY).orElseGet(HashSet::new);

  var removed = tickets.removeIf(s -> s.equals(request.getTicketId()));

  if (removed) {
    ctx.set(STATE_KEY, tickets);
    var ticketClnt = TicketServiceRestate.newClient(ctx);
    ticketClnt.oneWay().unreserve(Ticket.newBuilder().setTicketId(request.getTicketId()).build());
  }

Call the `expireTicket` function with:
```shell

-d '{"user_id": "123", "ticket_id": "456"}'
```

#### Implementing the ticket service

You can track the status of the tickets in the ticket service by storing it in the state.
Implement the `TicketService/reserve`, `TicketService/unreserve`, and `TicketService/markAsSold` functions to do this.

While you are developing them, you can use psql to monitor the state of the `TicketService`:

```shell
psql -h localhost -p 9071 -c "SELECT * FROM state WHERE service like '\''%TicketService%'\''";'
```

Use `watch` to see the state change in real-time:
```shell
watch -n 1 'psql -h localhost -p 9071 -c "select service, service_key_utf8, key, value_utf8 from state where service like '\''%TicketService%'\''";'
```

1. Implement the `TicketService/reserve` function.
The function first retrieves the value for the `"status"` state key.
If the value is set to `TicketStatus.Available`, then change it to `TicketStatus.Reserved` and
return `true` (reservation successful).
If the status isn't set to `TicketStatus.Available`, then return `false`.
Remove the sleep that you added before.

<>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const reserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
  const status =
    (await ctx.get<TicketStatus>("status")) ?? TicketStatus.Available;

  if (status === TicketStatus.Available) {
    ctx.set("status", TicketStatus.Reserved);
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
public static final StateKey<TicketStatus> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("status", JacksonSerdes.of(TicketStatus.class));

@Override
public BoolValue reserve(RestateContext ctx, Ticket request) throws TerminalException {
  var status = ctx.get(STATE_KEY).orElse(TicketStatus.Available);

  if (status.equals(TicketStatus.Available)) {
    ctx.set(STATE_KEY, TicketStatus.Reserved);
    return BoolValue.of(true);
  } else {
    return BoolValue.of(false);
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, you can't reserve the same ticket multiple times anymore.
Call `addTicket` multiple times for the same ID. The first time it returns `true`, afterwards `false`.
</details>
</>

2. Implement the `TicketService/unreserve` function.
The function should clear the value of the `"status"` key if it's not on status `TicketStatus.Sold`.

<>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const unreserve = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
    const status =
        (await ctx.get<TicketStatus>("status")) ?? TicketStatus.Available;

    if (status !== TicketStatus.Sold) {
        ctx.clear("status");
    }
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Override
public void unreserve(RestateContext ctx, Ticket request) throws TerminalException {
    var status = ctx.get(STATE_KEY).orElse(TicketStatus.Available);

    if (!status.equals(TicketStatus.Sold)) {
        ctx.clear(STATE_KEY);
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, the ticket reservation status is cleared when the delayed `expireTicket` call triggers.
Play around with reducing the delay of the `expireTicket` call in the `addTicket` function.
Try to reserve the same ticket ID multiple times, and see how you are able to reserve it again after the `unreserve` function executed.

</details>
</>

3. Implement the `TicketService/markAsSold` function.
The function should set the value of the `"status"` key to `TicketStatus.Sold` if it's reserved.

<>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const markAsSold = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => {
    const status =

    if (status === TicketStatus.Reserved) {
        ctx.set("status", TicketStatus.Sold);
    }
  }
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Override
public void markAsSold(RestateContext ctx, Ticket request) throws TerminalException {
    var status = ctx.get(STATE_KEY).orElse(TicketStatus.Available);

    if (status.equals(TicketStatus.Reserved)) {
        ctx.set(STATE_KEY, TicketStatus.Sold);
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the next section, you implement the `Checkout/checkout` function that calls `markAsSold`.
This ties the final parts together.

## Side effects

:::note Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `part3`.
:::

Restate's replay mechanism makes applications resilient to failures.
It only requires your code to be deterministic.

If you need to execute a non-deterministic code snippet, for example generating a UUID or communicating to an external system, then you should wrap it in a side effect.
The side effect executes the supplied function and eagerly stores the return value in Restate.
Upon replay, the stored value gets inserted and the function doesn't get re-executed.

:::tip
You can use a side effect to avoid re-execution during replay for any arbitrary piece of user code.
This includes pieces of time-consuming, deterministic user code.
:::

Use a side effect in `Checkout/checkout` to create and store a UUID (with the [uuid library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)) or idempotency key:

The highlighted line of code wraps the creation of the UUID in a side effect with a string return type.
When the `checkout()` function gets re-executed upon replay, Restate injects the stored value.

To experiment, you can print the idempotency key to the console and add a sleep to see how the UUID gets replayed after the suspension:

console.log("My idempotency key: " + idempotencyKey);

Remove the sleep again, before you continue.

:::caution
You can't execute any RestateContext calls from within a side effect.
This is invalid code.
:::

### 📝 Try it out
#### Executing the payment
The `checkout` function triggers the payment via some external payment provider (`PaymentClient`). You can find a payment client stub in `auxiliary/PaymentClient`.
The payment client has two methods:

- `get()` to create a new client,
- `call(idempotencyKey, amount)` to execute the payment for a certain idempotency key (String) and total amount (double/number).
The payment provider makes sure that exactly one payment gets processed for a single idempotency key.

Create a new payment client in `CheckoutService/Checkout`.
Assume every ticket costs 40 dollars.
Then execute the payment with the created idempotency key and store the boolean result of the call as the return value of the side effect.
Also return the boolean result at the end of the `checkout` function.

You see the `UserSession` service retrieving the cart and calling the checkout service.
The `Checkout` service then does a side effect, the payment, and another side effect.
The checkout success is propagated back to the `UserSession` service.

</details>

#### Finishing the checkout workflow

Once this works, you implement the rest of the checkout workflow:

- If the payment call was successful, then:
    - use the EmailClient to notify the users of the payment success.
    Prevent duplicate emails during retries by using a side effect.
    - let the calling `UserSession` mark all tickets as sold via `TicketService/markAsSold`.
- If the payment call was unsuccessful, then:
    - use the EmailClient to notify the users of the payment failure.
    Prevent duplicate emails during retries by using a side effect.

🥳 Except for a few resiliency tweaks, you have now fully implemented the ticket reservation system!
Try it out by reserving some new tickets and buying them by checking out the cart.

## Resiliency

:::note Implement it yourself or follow along by looking at the code under `part4`.
:::

As you have discovered throughout this tutorial, Restate makes your applications resilient out-of-the-box by:

- Making sure messages can't get lost by durably storing all calls in the log.
No more queues needed for asynchronous calls.
- Retrying failed invocations.
No more retry logic required for inter-service communication.
- Restoring partial progress of invocations, via its durable execution mechanism.
For example, if a service goes down due to an infrastructure failure, the ongoing invocations resume at the point in the user code where they left off.
- Ensuring consistent application state with its key-value store.
- Providing end-to-end exactly-once guarantees for incoming invocations.

:::tip Good news!
These features are switched on by default. No need to do anything.
:::

### Side effect retries

Also side effects are retried until they succeed.
You can observe this behavior by using the `paymentClient.failingCall` in `Checkout/checkout`:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const paymentClient = PaymentClient.get();
//highlight-start
const doPayment = () => paymentClient.failingCall(idempotencyKey, amount)
const success = await ctx.sideEffect(doPayment);
//highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
boolean success = ctx.sideEffect(CoreSerdes.BOOLEAN, () -> paymentClient.failingCall(idempotencyKey, totalPrice));
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



You now call `paymentClient.failingCall` which fails two times before succeeding.
A failing side effect is retried until it succeeds.
Have a look at the logs to see the retries.

Have a look at the [error handling documentation](/services/sdk/error-handling) to learn how to make a call fail terminally (without retries).
:::
    
## Tracing
Restate exposes OpenTelemetry traces of your invocations.

Run the Jaeger container with:

```shell
docker run -d --name jaeger \
    -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
    -p 4317:4317 \
    -p 16686:16686 \
    jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.46
```

Then restart the runtime with the tracing endpoint defined as an environment variable:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

```shell
docker stop restate_dev && \
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -e RESTATE_OBSERVABILITY__TRACING__ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 --network=host docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

Register the services again (required because the state got wiped when the runtime was restarted with the `--rm` flag):
```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```shell
docker stop restate_dev && \
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d -e RESTATE_OBSERVABILITY__TRACING__ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:4317 -p 8080:8080 -p 9070-9072:9070-9072 docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION

```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://host.docker.internal:9080"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Go to the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686.

Send requests to the runtime by adding tickets and checking out.

In the Jaeger UI, select the `UserSession` service from the service dropdown.
You should see the `addTicket` and `checkout` requests listed:

![Jaeger traces tour](/img/jaeger_traces_tour_handler.png)

Have a look at the traces of the `checkout` call:

![Checkout call traces](/img/jaeger_checkout_traces_tour_handler.png)

You can see the calls that were done to Restate, for example invoke, sleep, one way call, get state, etc., and their timings.
If you expand one of the traces, you can see tags describing some metadata of the context call, for example invocation id and call arguments.


You can use Jaeger's search feature to find specific traces.
For example, to find the traces of a specific invocation, you can enter the Restate invocation ID, which you can find in the logs, into the search field `Tags`:
```
restate.invocation.id="T4pIkIJIGAsBiiGDV2dxK7PkkKnWyWHE"
```
![Checkout call search](/img/jaeger_invocationid_search_handler.png)

Or for example, to search all traces of `checkout` calls, you can select `invoke checkout` in the `Operation` dropdown.

Note that one-way calls are shown as separate traces.
The traces of the original call contain the one-way call, but the timing represents only the scheduling of the one-way call in the runtime.
To search for the traces of the execution of the one-way call, you can use the `restate.invocation.id`:

![Jaeger background call](/img/jaeger_tour_background_call_handler.png)

For more information, have a look at the [tracing docs](/restate/tracing).

## 🏁 The end
You reached the end of this tutorial!

:::info 🚩 Have a look at the fully implemented app in `part4`, and run it with:
<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```shell
npm run part4

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```shell

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::



Let's recap what you've covered:
- reliable, suspendable request-response calls
- one-way calls without the need for queues
- suspensions for external communication
- durable timers for sleep or for calling other services
- concurrency guarantees for keyed/unkeyed services
- persistent application state
- storing the results of non-deterministic operations or external calls as side effects
- resiliency and retries
- tracing with Jaeger

## Next steps
This tutorial didn't cover anything related to deployment.
In this tutorial, you ran the services as long-running services in Docker containers.
Restate services can run with minimal changes on AWS Lambda as well.

Possible next step:
- [Run the examples](https://github.com/restatedev/examples)
- [Check out the SDK documentation](/category/api)
