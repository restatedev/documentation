# Overview

The Restate TypeScript SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-typescript repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript)).

Add the `@restatedev/restate-sdk` dependency to your NodeJS project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1), a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects), or a [Workflow](/concepts/services#workflows). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services

[Services](/concepts/services#services-1) and their handlers are defined as follows:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_service.ts
```

- Specify that you want to create a Service via _`restate.service`_.
- Specify the service name. The service can then be called at `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/MyService/myHandler`.
- The service definition contains a list of handlers.
  Each handler has a name (`myHandler`) and a function that implements the handler logic.
  The function has the Restate Context as its first argument.
  Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
  The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
- The handler input parameters and return type are optional and can be of any type, as long as they can be serialized as a Buffer with _`Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`_ and deserialized with _`JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`_.
- Export the service definition `MyService` so that it can be used by other handlers to call the service. (See [Service Communication docs](/develop/ts/service-communication).)
- Finally, create an endpoint and bind the service(s) to the Restate endpoint. Listen on the specified port (default `9080`) for connections and requests.

## Virtual Objects

[Virtual Objects](/concepts/services#virtual-objects) and their handlers are defined similarly to services, with the following differences:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_virtual_object.ts
```

- Specify that you want to create a Virtual Object via _`restate.object`_.
- The first argument of each handler must be the `ObjectContext` parameter.
Handlers with the `ObjectContext` parameter can write to the K/V state store.
Only one handler can be active at a time, to ensure consistency.
- If you want to have a handler that executes concurrently to the others and doesn't have write access to the K/V state, wrap the handler in `handlers.object.shared` and use the `ObjectSharedContext`.
For example, you can use these handlers to read K/V state, or interact with the blocking handler.

## Workflows

[Workflows](/concepts/services#workflows) are a special type of Virtual Objects, their definition is similar but with the following differences:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/workflow.ts
```

- Create the workflow with _`restate.workflow`_.
- Every workflow implementation needs to have a handler called `run` that implements the workflow logic.
This handler uses the `WorkflowContext` to interact with the SDK.
The `run` handler executes exactly one time per workflow execution/object.
- The other handlers of the workflow are used to interact with the workflow: either query it, or signal it.
They use the `WorkflowSharedContext` to interact with the SDK.
These handlers can run concurrently with the `run` handler and can still be called after the `run` handler has finished.
- [Have a look at the workflow docs to learn more.](/develop/ts/workflows)


Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's have a look at what the Restate Context allows you to do.
