# Overview

The Restate Python SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-python repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-python)).

Add the `restate_sdk[serde]` requirement to your Python project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1), a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects), or a [Workflow](/concepts/services#workflows). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services

[Services](/concepts/services#services-1) and their handlers are defined as follows:

```python
# collapse_prequel
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/my_service.py
```

- Initialize a `Service` and specify the service name (here `MyService`).
- The service definition contains a list of handlers.
  Each handler is annotated by `@service_name.handler()`, optionally you can override the name of the handler (here `myHandler`).
  This is the name that will be used to call the handler, here you would use `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/MyService/myHandler`.
- The function has the Restate Context as its first argument.
  Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
  The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- The handler input argument (at most one) and return type are optional and can be of any primitive type or `TypedDict`, or you can specify the [Pydantic model, dataclasses, or custom serialization]((/develop/python/serialization)).
=======
- The handler input argument (at most one) and return type are optional and can be of any primitive type or a `TypedDict`.
  They need to be serializable with `json.dumps` and deserializable with `json.loads`.
  For any other types, you can use [Pydantic or a custom serializer](/develop/python/serialization).
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- Finally, initialize the app and bind the service(s) to it.
  The SDK follows the [ASGI standard](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) to serve the app.
  The templates and examples use [Hypercorn](https://pypi.org/project/Hypercorn/) as the server.
  Have a look at the [serving docs](/develop/python/serving) to learn more.

## Virtual Objects

[Virtual Objects](/concepts/services#virtual-objects) and their handlers are defined similarly to services, with the following differences:

```python
# collapse_prequel
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/my_virtual_object.py
```

- Initialize a `VirtualObject` and specify the object's name (here `MyVirtualObject`).
- The first argument of each handler must be the `ObjectContext` parameter.
Handlers with the `ObjectContext` parameter can write to the K/V state store.
Only one handler can be active at a time, to ensure consistency.
- You can retrieve the key of the object you are in via `ctx.key()`.
- If you want to have a handler that executes concurrently to the others and doesn't have write access to the K/V state, add `kind="shared"` as annotation argument and use the `ObjectSharedContext`.
You can use these handlers, for example, to read K/V state and expose it to the outside world, or to interact with the blocking handler (e.g. resolve awakeables).

## Workflows

[Workflows](/concepts/services#workflows) are a special type of Virtual Objects, their definition is similar but with the following differences:

```python
# collapse_prequel
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/my_workflow.py
```

- Initialize a `Workflow` and specify its name (here `MyWorkflow`).
- Every workflow implementation needs to have a handler annotated with `@workflow_name.main()` called `run` that implements the workflow logic.
This handler uses the `WorkflowContext` to interact with the SDK.
- The `run` handler executes exactly one time per workflow execution/object. You can retrieve the ID of the workflow execution via `ctx.key()`.
- The `run` handler executes a set of steps/activities. These can be inlined SDK actions (for example [run block](/develop/python/journaling-results#journaled-actions) or [sleep](/develop/python/durable-timers)), or abstracted into calls to other handlers.
- The other handlers of the workflow are used to interact with the workflow: [either query it, or signal it](/develop/python/workflows#implementing-workflows).
They use the `WorkflowSharedContext` to interact with the SDK.
These handlers can run concurrently with the `run` handler and can still be called after the `run` handler has finished.

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's have a look at what the Restate Context allows you to do.
