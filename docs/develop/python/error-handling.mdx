# Error Handling

Restate handles retries for failed invocations.
By default, Restate does infinite retries with an exponential backoff strategy.

For failures for which you do not want retries, but instead want the invocation to end and the error message
to be propagated back to the caller, you can throw a **terminal error**.

You can throw a terminal exception with an optional HTTP status code and a message anywhere in your handler, as follows:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/error_handling.ts
```

You can catch terminal exceptions. For example, you can catch the terminal exception that comes out of a [call to another service](/develop/ts/service-communication#request-response-calls), and build your control flow around it.
