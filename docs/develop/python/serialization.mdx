# Serialization

Restate sends data over the network for storing state, journaling actions, awakeables, etc.
There are multiple ways to specify which (de)serializers should be used.

## Default Serialization

By default, payloads are serialized with `bytes(json.dumps(obj), "utf-8")` and deserialized with `json.loads(buf)`.
If this does not work for your data type, then you need to specify a custom serializer, as shown below.

## Custom Serialization

To write a custom serializer, you implement the `Serde` interface.

For example a custom JSON serializer could look like this:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#custom
```

You then use this serializer in your handlers, as follows:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#using_custom_serde
```
