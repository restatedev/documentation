# Serialization

Restate sends data over the network for storing state, journaling actions, awakeables, etc.
There are multiple ways to specify which (de)serializers should be used.

## Default Serialization

By default, payloads are serialized with `bytes(json.dumps(obj), "utf-8")` and deserialized with `json.loads(buf)`.
If this does not work for your data type, then you need to specify a custom serializer, as shown below.

## Pydantic

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is a data validation and parsing library for Python.

You can use Pydantic models to define the structure of your data: handler input/output, state, etc.

To serialize and deserialize Pydantic models, you can use the `PydanticJsonSerde` included in the Restate SDK:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#using_pydantic
```

<Admonition type="tip" title={"Pydantic & OpenAPI"}>
    Pydantic integrates well with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/). Restate generates the OpenAPI specifications for you.
    If you use Pydantic, you can use the OpenAPI-generated clients to interact with your services.
    You can find example clients in the UI playground (click on your service in the overview and then on playground).

## Custom Serialization

To write a custom serializer, you implement the `Serde` interface.

For example a custom JSON serializer could look like this:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#custom
```

You then use this serializer in your handlers, as follows:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#using_custom_serde
```
