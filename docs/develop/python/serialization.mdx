# Serialization

Restate sends data over the network for storing state, journaling actions, awakeables, etc.
There are multiple ways to specify which (de)serializers should be used.

## Default Serialization
By default, the SDK serializes the journal entry with the [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#) library.
If this does not work for your data type, then you need to specify a custom serializer, as shown below.

## Pydantic

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is a data validation and parsing library for Python.
You can use Pydantic models to define the structure of your data: handler input/output, state, etc.

Make sure to install the optional `serde` dependency of the Restate SDK: `restate-sdk[serde]`.

Then do the following:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#using_pydantic
```

<Admonition type="tip" title={"Pydantic & OpenAPI"}>
    Pydantic integrates well with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/). Restate generates the OpenAPI specifications for you.
    If you use Pydantic, you can use the OpenAPI-generated clients to interact with your services.
    You can find example clients in the UI playground (click on your service in the overview and then on playground).

## Dataclasses

You can also use Python's built-in `dataclasses` to define the structure of your data.
Make sure to install the optional `serde` dependency of the Restate SDK `restate-sdk[serde]`.

Then add a type hint in a similar way as you would with Pydantic.

## Custom Serialization

To write a custom serializer, you implement the `Serde` interface.

For example a custom JSON serializer could look like this:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#custom
```

You then use this serializer in your handlers, as follows:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serialization.py#using_custom_serde
```
