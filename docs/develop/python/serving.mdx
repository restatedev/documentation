# Serving
Restate services can run in a few ways: as a Node.js HTTP handler, as a AWS
Lambda handler, or on other Javascript runtimes like Bun, Deno and Cloudflare
Workers.

## Creating an Node.js HTTP handler
1. Create the endpoint
2. Bind one or multiple services to it.
3. Listen on the specified port (default `9080`) for connections and requests.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#endpoint
```

    <summary>Customizing the HTTP2 server</summary>

    If you need to manually control or customize the HTTP2 server, you can call `http2Handler()` instead of `listen()`, and then use it to manually instantiate the HTTP server:

    ```ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#custom_endpoint
    ```
</details>

## Creating a Lambda handler

To register your service as a Lambda function, use the `/lambda` import
component and change the endpoint into a Lambda handler.
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving_lambda.ts#lambda
```

Have a look at the [deployment section](/category/aws--aws-lambda)
for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.

    The implementation of your services and handlers remains the same for both deployment options.

## Creating a fetch handler
Other Javascript runtimes like Deno, Bun and Cloudflare Workers have
build on top of the [Fetch Standard](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch) for
defining HTTP server handlers. To register your service as a fetch handler, use
the `/fetch` import component.
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving_fetch.ts#fetch
```
By default, a fetch handler will not advertise itself as working
bidirectionally; the SDK will end the HTTP request at each suspension point,
and the Restate runtime will re-invoke the service when there is more work to
do.

However, you can use the method `.bidirectional()` on the endpoint builder to
change this on supported platforms, which will improve latencies once the
service is re-registered with the runtime.
- Deno and Deno Deploy support HTTP2 and therefore bidirectional mode can be enabled.
- Bun does not yet support HTTP2, but its HTTP1.1 implementation does support
bidirectional communication, as long as there is not a buffering load balancer
between the client and the Bun server. Bun services must be discovered with
the `--use-http1.1` CLI flag.
- Cloudflare Workers do not support end-to-end HTTP2 or bidirectional HTTP1.1,
and enabling bidirectional mode will cause invocations to stall and time out.
Services running on Workers must be must be discovered with the `--use-http1.1`
CLI flag.

## Validating request identity

SDKs can validate that incoming requests come from a particular Restate
instance. You can find out more about request identity in the [Security docs](/operate/security#locking-down-service-access)

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#identity
```
