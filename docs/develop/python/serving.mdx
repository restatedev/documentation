# Serving
Restate services can run in a few ways: as an HTTP handler, or as an AWS Lambda handler.
For both, you do the following:

1. Create the app
2. Bind one or multiple services to it.

```python example.py
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serving.py#endpoint
```

The Python SDK follows the [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) standard for the serving of the services.
The templates and examples use [Hypercorn](https://pypi.org/project/Hypercorn/) to serve the services.
You can run them as follows:

```shell
python -m hypercorn --config hypercorn-config.toml -b localhost:9080 example:app
```

## Validating request identity

SDKs can validate that incoming requests come from a particular Restate
instance. You can find out more about request identity in the [Security docs](/operate/security#locking-down-service-access)

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/serving.py#identity
```
