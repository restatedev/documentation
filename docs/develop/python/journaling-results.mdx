# Journaling Results

Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
This means that non-deterministic results (e.g. database responses, UUID generation) need to be stored in the execution log, so they can be replayed.

You can use `ctx.run` to do this.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string response is stored in Restate:
```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/journaling_results.py#side_effect
```

You cannot use the Restate context within `ctx.run`.
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting other journaled actions.

You can return any payload that can be serialized with `bytes(json.dumps(obj), "utf-8")` and deserialized with `json.loads(buf)`.
If not, you can use [Pydantic](/develop/python/serialization#pydantic) or a [custom serializer](/develop/python/serialization#custom-serialization).

<Admonition type="caution" title={"Immediately await journaled actions"}>
Always immediately await `ctx.run`, before doing any other context calls.
If not, you might bump into non-determinism errors during replay,
because the journaled result can get interleaved with the other context calls in the journal in a non-deterministic way.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Failure semantics">
Failures in `ctx.run` have the same semantics as failures in the rest of your handler code.
By default, the `ctx.run` function is retried infinitely on failure, unless you specify differently in the retry policy ([see below](/develop/python/journaling-results#run-block-retry-policies)) or throw a [`TerminalError`](/develop/python/error-handling).
</Admonition>

### Run-block Retry Policies

You can configure the retry policy for the `ctx.run` block:

```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/retries.py?1
```

This way you can override the default retry behavior of your Restate service for specific operations.

If you set a maximum number of attempts, then the `ctx.run` block will fail with a [`TerminalError`](/develop/python/error-handling) once the retries are exhausted.
Have a look at the [error handling docs](/develop/python/error-handling) and [Sagas guide](/guides/sagas) to learn how to handle these.
