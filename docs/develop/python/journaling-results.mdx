# Journaling Results

Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
This means that non-deterministic results (e.g. database responses, UUID generation) need to be stored in the execution log.
The SDK offers some functionalities to help you with this:
1. **[Journaled actions](/develop/python/journaling-results#journaled-actions)**: Run any block of code and store the result in Restate. Restate replays the result instead of re-executing the block on retries.

## Journaled actions
You can store the result of a (non-deterministic) operation in the Restate execution log (e.g. database requests, HTTP calls, etc).
Restate replays the result instead of re-executing the operation on retries.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string response is stored in Restate:
```python
CODE_LOAD::python/src/develop/journaling_results.py#side_effect
```

You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a side effect.
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting other journaled actions.

You can return any payload that can be serialized with _`bytes(json.dumps(obj), "utf-8")`_ and deserialized with _`json.loads(buf)`_.
If not, you need to specify a [custom serializer](/develop/python/serialization).

<Admonition type="caution" title={"Immediately await journaled actions"}>
Always immediately await `ctx.run`, before doing any other context calls.
If not, you might bump into non-determinism errors during replay,
because the journaled result can get interleaved with the other context calls in the journal in a non-deterministic way.
