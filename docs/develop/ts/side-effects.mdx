# Determinism & side effects

:::danger
Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
For this to work, the user code needs to be deterministic.
:::

To help you with keeping code execution deterministic, the SDK has a few built-in functions:
1. **Side effects**: For all other non-deterministic code, you need to use side effects, as explained [below](/develop/ts/side-effects#side-effects).
2. **Promise/awaitable combinators**: Check the built-in helper functions [listed below](/develop/ts/side-effects#promise-awaitable-combinators).
3. **Random generators:** For example UUIDs and random numbers. Check the built-in helper functions [listed below](/develop/ts/side-effects#built-in-helper-functions).


## Side effects
Side effects help relaxing the constraints on determinism.
If your code does something that is non-deterministic, then you have to wrap it in a side effect.
By doing this, Restate makes sure that the result is persistently stored in the execution log
and that the value is retained during replays.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string return value is stored as a side effect in Restate:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_side_effect>-<end_side_effect>
```

:::danger
Always immediately await side effects, before doing any other context calls.
If not, you might bump into non-determinism errors during replay,
because the side effect can get interleaved with the other context calls in the journal in a non-deterministic way.
:::


Once stored, the request to the database will not get re-executed upon replay, but the first result will be used instead.

:::caution
You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a side effect!
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting side effects.
:::



### Retrying on failure

If the side effect closure throws an error, then it is retried infinitely using an exponential backoff strategy until it succeeds.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_retry>-<end_retry>
```

**Manually controlling the retry policy**

Instead of using an infinite exponential backoff strategy, you can also specify a finite retry policy when executing a side effect.
A finite retry policy retries a failing side effect function until all retry attempts are depleted.
If this happens, then the side effect fails terminally with a `restate.TerminalError` which is propagated to the user code.
In order to configure the retry policy you need to provide a `RetrySettings` object:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_manual>-<end_manual>
```

The `RetrySettings` object has the following fields:
- `initialDelayMs` (number): The initial delay between retries. As more retries happen, the delay may change per the policy.
- `maxDelayMs` (number): Optionally, the maximum delay between retries. No matter what the policy says, this is the maximum time
  that Restate sleeps between retries. If not set, there is effectively no limit (internally the limit is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
- `maxRetries` (number): The maximum number of retries before this function fails with an exception. If not set, there is effectively no limit (internally the limit is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
- `policy`:  Optionally, the retry policy to use (`FIXED_DELAY` or `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`). Defaults to `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`.
- `name` (string): Optionally, the name of side effect action that is used in error and log messages around retries.

For example:
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_retry_settings>-<end_retry_settings>
```

### Terminal failures of side effects

By default, a side effect function is retried infinitely on failure.
If you want to let the side effect fail terminally, then you have to throw a terminal error.
A terminal error will stop the infinite retry strategy and lets the SDK propagate the error to the user code where it can be handled.
The terminal error will also be recorded in the journal so that it will be deterministically thrown on replay.

You can throw a terminal error by using `restate.TerminalError`:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_terminal>-<end_terminal>
```

## Promise/Awaitable combinators
The SDK provides combinators for working with promises.

**CombineablePromise.all():**

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_combine_all>-<end_combine_all>
```
Creates a Promise that is either:
1. Resolved with an array of results, when all of the provided Promises resolve.
2. Rejected when any Promise is rejected.

Similar to [`Promise.all()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all),
but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

**CombineablePromise.any():**

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_combine_any>-<end_combine_any>
```

Creates a promise with two possible outcomes:
1. The promise resolves with the first successful result from the input promises, once any of them resolves.
2. The promise gets rejected when all the input promises are rejected (including when an empty iterable is passed),
returning an `AggregateError` containing an array of the reasons for rejection.

Similar to [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any),
but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

**CombineablePromise.race():**

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_combine_race>-<end_combine_race>
```

Creates a Promise that is:
1. Resolved when any of the provided Promises are resolved.
2. Rejected when any of the provided Promises are rejected.

Similar to [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race),
but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

**CombineablePromise.allSettled():**

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_combine_allsettled>-<end_combine_allsettled>
```

Creates a promise that resolves once all the input promises have settled (including when an empty iterable is passed).
It returns an array of objects describing the outcome of each promise, whether resolved or rejected.

Similar to [`Promise.allSettled()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled),
but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

## Built-in helper functions
Two common non-deterministic actions are the generation of UUIDs and random numbers.
The SDK provides helper functions for those.

### Generating UUIDs

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_uuid>-<end_uuid>

```

:::danger
Do not use this in cryptographic contexts.
:::

:::tip
You can use this to generate stable idempotency keys with one line of code.
For example, imagine a payment service where you want to avoid having duplicate payments during retries.
You could use this utility to generate a UUID and then use that UUID as identifier of the payment.
You only allow the payment to go through if no payment with that UUID was done yet.
Restate guarantees that once the UUID is stored, it is retained during retries.
:::

### Generating random numbers

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/side_effects.ts#<start_random_nb>-<end_random_nb>
```

This returns a new pseudorandom float within the range [0,1].Calls to `ctx.rand.random()`

:::note
This is the equivalent of JS `Math.random()` but deterministic, because it gets seeded by the invocation ID of the current invocation.
Since retries use the same invocation ID, they will get the same random number.
