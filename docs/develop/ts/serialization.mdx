# Serialization

Restate sends data over the network for storing state, journaling actions, awakeables, etc.

By default, Typescript SDK uses the built-in [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)
support to perform (de)serialization, but it is possible to override this behavior using the `Serde` interface.

For example, to customize the `Serde` to use for the handler input and output:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serialization.ts#service_definition
```

To customize the serde to use on requests:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serialization.ts#client
```

When sending a request to a handler configured with custom serde(s) you always need to manually specify them, because the client does not automatically infer what serde(s) should be used.

To customize the serde to use for state:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serialization.ts#state
```

For awakeables:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serialization.ts#awakeable
```

For `run`:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serialization.ts#run
```
