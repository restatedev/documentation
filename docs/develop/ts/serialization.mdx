# Serialization

For some SDK operations, Restate needs to send data over the network, for example for storing state, doing side effects and awakeables.
The SDK serializes values with `Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(payload))` and deserializes them with `JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`.
Make sure that the data you want to serialize is JSON serializable.
