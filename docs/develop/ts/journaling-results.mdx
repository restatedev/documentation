# Journaling Results

Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
This means that non-deterministic results (e.g. database responses, UUID generation) need to be stored in the execution log.
The SDK offers some functionalities to help you with this:
1. **[Journaled actions](/develop/ts/journaling-results#journaled-actions)**: Run any block of code and store the result in Restate. Restate replays the result instead of re-executing the block on retries.
2. **[`CombineablePromise` combinators](/develop/ts/journaling-results#combineable-promise-combinators)**: Log the order in which CombineablePromises are resolved/rejected, to ensure deterministic replay.
3. **[Random generators](/develop/ts/journaling-results#generating-randoms)**: Built-in helpers for generating stable UUIDs and random numbers.

## Journaled actions
You can store the result of a (non-deterministic) operation in the Restate execution log (e.g. database requests, HTTP calls, etc).
Restate replays the result instead of re-executing the operation on retries.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string response is stored in Restate:
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#side_effect
```

You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a side effect.
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting other journaled actions.

You can store any result value that can be serialized as a Buffer with _`Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`_ and deserialized with _`JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`_.

<Admonition type="caution" title={"Immediately await journaled actions"}>
Always immediately await `ctx.run`, before doing any other context calls.
If not, you might bump into non-determinism errors during replay,
because the journaled result can get interleaved with the other context calls in the journal in a non-deterministic way.

## Combineable Promise combinators
Operations such as calls, awakeables, and sleep return a `CombineablePromise`.
The SDK provides combinators for working with `CombineablePromise`.
Restate then logs the order in which they are resolved or rejected, to make them deterministic on replay.

    **Await all** creates a promise that is similar to [`Promise.all()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable:
    - Resolves with an array of results, once all input promises are resolved.
    - Rejects when any input promise is rejected.

    ```ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#promises?1
    ```

    ---

    **Await any** creates a promise that is similar to [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any),
    but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable:
    - Resolves with the result of the first successfully resolved input promise.
    - Rejects when all the input promises are rejected (including when an empty iterable is passed).
    This results in an `AggregateError` containing an array of the reasons for rejection.

    ```ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#promises?2
    ```

    ---

    **Race** creates a Promise that is similar to [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race),
    but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.:
    - Resolves when any of the input promises are resolved.
    - Rejects when any of the input promises are rejected.

    ```ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#promises?3
    ```

    ---

    **Await all settled** creates a promise that resolves once all the input promises have settled (including when an empty iterable is passed).
    It returns an array of objects describing the outcome of each promise, whether resolved or rejected.
    Similar to [`Promise.allSettled()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled),
    but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

    ```ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#promises?4
    ```

## Generating randoms
The SDK provides helper functions for the deterministic generation of UUIDs and random numbers. Restate seeds the random number generator with the invocation ID, so it always returns the same value on retries.

<CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>
    ### Generating UUIDs

    You can use these UUIDs to generate stable idempotency keys, to deduplicate operations. For example, you can use this to let a payment service avoid duplicate payments during retries.

    Do not use this in cryptographic contexts.

    ```typescript
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#uuid
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>
<CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>

    ### Generating random numbers


    This returns a new pseudorandom float within the range `[0,1]`.
    This is the equivalent of JS `Math.random()` but deterministically replayable.

    ```typescript
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/journaling_results.ts#random_nb
    ```
