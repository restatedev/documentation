# Overview

This section offers a TypeScript SDK ([sdk-typescript repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript)).

:::info TS Handler API vs. gRPC API
Restate currently supports two TypeScript APIs for implementing services: the Handler API and the gRPC API.
The gRPC API requires you to specify the services, methods and data types via a Protobuf definition, as explained in the [service contract docs](/develop/service_type#restate-service-contract).
The Handler API does not require this.

## Installation

:::tip
Have a look at the [TypeScript Quickstart](/get_started/quickstart?sdk=ts)!
:::

Add the `@restatedev/restate-sdk` dependency to your NodeJS project to start developing Restate services.

## API Examples

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

Below is an example of a TypeScript service with the Handler API.

This example shows a greeter service comprising two methods:
- `greet`: returns a greeting as a response without performing any additional operations.
- `countGreetings`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/overview_handler.ts
```

The app logic is implemented inside the `greet` and `countGreetings` functions.
The `restate.KeyedContext` is supplied as the first argument.
The [Restate context](/develop/sdk/restate-context) enables interaction with Restate (call other methods, retrieve state, etc.).
The `countGreetings` function uses the `restate.KeyedContext` because it belongs to a keyed service.
For unkeyed services, you would use `restate.Context`.

Finally, the endpoint is set up to serve both functions.
The service is registered as a keyed service under the path `greeter`, and the `greet` and `countGreetings` routes are added.
The `greet` function can now be called by sending a request to `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/greeter/greet` or `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/greeter/countGreetings`.

For more information on how to set up the routers and the Restate server, have a look at the [serving docs](/develop/sdk/serving).

<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="TypeScript-gRPC">

Below is an example of a TypeScript gRPC service.

The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API uses the `protobufjs` and `ts-proto` dependencies to work with the [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)-generated TypeScript code. So add these as well to your `package.json`.

This example shows a greeter service comprising two methods:
- `greet`: returns a greeting as a response without performing any additional operations.
- `countGreetings`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts-grpc/src/develop/overview.ts
```

The interface of the gRPC service is defined in the [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) service contracts, that are shown below.
Within the method, the Restate context is retrieved, enabling interaction with Restate (e.g. calling other services).
For keyed services, you use the `restate.KeyedContext`. For unkeyed services, instead, you use the `restate.Context`.
Finally, the endpoint is set up to serve both methods of the greeter service.

This is what corresponding Protobuf definition would look like for this service:

```protobuf
CODE_LOAD::ts-grpc/proto/greeter.proto
```

To understand the Restate-specific parts of this Protobuf definition, have a look at the documentation [here](/develop/service_type#restate-service-contract).

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's dive into the details!
