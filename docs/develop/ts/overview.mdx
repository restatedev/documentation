# Overview

The Restate TypeScript SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-typescript repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript)).

Add the `@restatedev/restate-sdk` dependency to your NodeJS project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1) or of a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services

Services and their handlers are defined as follows:


## Virtual Objects

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/overview_handler.ts
```

This example shows a greeter service comprising two handlers:
- `greet`: returns a greeting as a response without performing any additional operations.
- `countGreetings`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name.

The app logic is implemented inside the `greet` and `countGreetings` functions.
The `restate.KeyedContext` is supplied as the first argument.
The [Restate context](/develop/ts/restate-context) enables interaction with Restate (call other methods, retrieve state, etc.).
The `countGreetings` function uses the `restate.KeyedContext` because it belongs to a keyed service.
For unkeyed services, you would use `restate.Context`.

Finally, the endpoint is set up to serve both functions.
The service is registered as a keyed service under the path `greeter`, and the `greet` and `countGreetings` routes are added.
The `greet` function can now be called by sending a request to `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/greeter/greet` or `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/greeter/countGreetings`.

For more information on how to set up the routers and the Restate server, have a look at the [serving docs](/develop/ts/serving).

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's dive into the details!
