# Overview

The Restate TypeScript SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-typescript repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript)).

Add the `@restatedev/restate-sdk` dependency to your NodeJS project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1), a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects), or a [Workflow](/concepts/services#workflows). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services

[Services](/concepts/services#services-1) and their handlers are defined as follows:
<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_service.ts
```

</CH.Code>

- [Create the service](focus://3,10)
- Specify [the service name.](focus://4) The service can then be called at `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/MyService/myHandler`.
- [List the handlers.](focus://5:8)
  [Each handler has a name (`myHandler`) and a function that implements the handler logic.](focus://6)
  The function has the Restate Context as its first argument.
  Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
  The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
- The handler input parameters and return type are optional and can be of any type, as long as they can be serialized as a Buffer with _`Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`_ and deserialized with _`JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`_.
- [Export the service definition](focus://12) so that it can be used by other handlers to call the service. (See [Service Communication docs](/develop/ts/service-communication).)
- [Create an endpoint](focus://14,15) and [bind the service(s)](focus://16) to the Restate endpoint. [Listen](focus://17) on the specified port (default `9080`) for connections and requests.

</CH.Section>

## Virtual Objects

[Virtual Objects](/concepts/services#virtual-objects) and their handlers are defined similarly to services, with the following differences:

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_virtual_object.ts
```

</CH.Code>

- [Create the virtual object](focus://4)
- [The first argument of the handler must be the `ObjectContext` parameter](focus://7).
Handlers with the `ObjectContext` parameter can write to the K/V state store.
Only one handler can be active at a time, to ensure consistency.
- [If you want to have a handler that executes concurrently to the others and doesn't have write access to the K/V state, wrap the handler in `handlers.object.shared` and use the `ObjectSharedContext`.](focus://10)
For example, you can use these handlers to read K/V state, or interact with the blocking handler.
</CH.Section>

## Workflows

[Workflows](/concepts/services#workflows) are a special type of Virtual Objects, their definition is similar but with the following differences:

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code lineNumbers={"true"}>

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/workflow.ts
        ```

    </CH.Code>

    - [Create the workflow](focus://3,17)
    - [Every workflow implementation needs to have a handler called `run` that implements the workflow logic. This handler uses the `WorkflowContext` to interact with the SDK. The `run` handler executes exactly one time per workflow execution/object.](focus://6:11)
    - [The other handlers of the workflow are used to interact with the workflow: either query it, or signal it. They use the `WorkflowSharedContext` to interact with the SDK. These handlers can run concurrently with the `run` handler and can still be called after the `run` handler has finished.](focus://13:15)
    - [Have a look at the workflow docs to learn more.](/develop/ts/workflows)

</CH.Section>



Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's have a look at what the Restate Context allows you to do.
