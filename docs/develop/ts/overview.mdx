# Overview

The Restate TypeScript SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-typescript repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript)).

Add the `@restatedev/restate-sdk` dependency to your NodeJS project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1) or of a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services

Services and their handlers are defined as follows:
<CH.Section>
<CH.Code lineNumbers={"true"}>

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_service.ts
```

</CH.Code>

- [Create the service](focus://3,10)
- Specify [the service name.](focus://4) The service can then be called at `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/MyService/myHandler`.
- [List the handlers.](focus://5:8)
  [Each handler has a name (`myHandler`) and a function that implements the handler logic.](focus://6)
  The function has the Restate Context as its first argument.
  Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
  The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
- The handler input parameters and return type are optional and can be of any type, as long as they can be serialized as a Buffer with _`Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`_ and deserialized with _`JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`_.
- [Export the service definition](focus://12) so that it can be used by other handlers to call the service. (See [Service Communication docs](/develop/ts/service-communication).)
- [Create an endpoint](focus://14,15) and [bind the service(s)](focus://16) to the Restate endpoint. [Listen](focus://17) on the specified port (default `9080`) for connections and requests.

</CH.Section>

## Virtual Objects

Virtual objects and their handlers are defined similarly to services, with the following differences:

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code lineNumbers={"true"}>

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_virtual_object.ts
```

</CH.Code>

- [Create the virtual object](focus://3,10)
- [The handlers use the `ObjectContext` instead of the `Context`.](focus://6)

</CH.Section>

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's have a look at what the Restate Context allows you to do.
