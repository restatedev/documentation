# Awakeables

Awakeables pause an invocation while waiting for another process to complete a task.
You can use this pattern to let a handler execute a task somewhere else and retrieve the result.
This pattern is also known as the callback (task token) pattern.

<CH.Section>
    <CH.Code>
        ```typescript my_handler.ts
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/awakeable.ts#create
        ```
    </CH.Code>

    1. [The handler **creates an awakeable**](focus://1,2). This contains a [String identifier](focus://2) and a Promise/Awaitable.
    2. [The handler **triggers a task/process** and attaches the awakeable ID](focus://4)  (e.g. over Kafka, via HTTP,...).
    For example, send an HTTP request to a service that executes the task, and attach the ID to the payload.
    You use `ctx.run` to avoid retriggering the task this on retries.
    3. [The handler **waits** until the other process has executed the task.](focus://6)

    4. **The external process completes the awakeable** when the task is finished by:

        <CH.Code>
            ```shell resolve_curl.sh
            curl localhost:8080/restate/awakeables/prom_1PePOqp/resolve -H 'content-type: application/json'
                -d '{"hello": "world"}'
            ```

            ```shell reject_curl.sh
            curl localhost:8080/restate/awakeables/prom_1PePOqp/reject -H 'content-type: text/plain' \
                -d 'Very bad error!'
            ```

            ```typescript external_process_resolve.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/awakeable.ts#resolve
            ```

            ```typescript external_proces_reject.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/awakeable.ts#reject
            ```

        </CH.Code>
        - **Resolving** the awakeable
            - [Over HTTP](focus://resolve_curl.sh#1:2) with [its ID](focus://resolve_curl.sh#1[40:52]) and [an optional payload](focus://resolve_curl.sh#2)
            - [Via the SDK with its ID and an optional payload](focus://external_process_resolve.ts#1)
        - **Rejecting** the awakeable. This throws [a terminal error](/develop/java/error-handling) in the waiting handler.
            - [Over HTTP](focus://reject_curl.sh#1:2) with [its ID](focus://reject_curl.sh#1[40:52]) and [a failure reason](focus://reject_curl.sh#2)
            - [Via the SDK with its ID and a failure reason](focus://external_proces_reject.ts#1)
</CH.Section>
    5. The handler **receives the payload and resumes**.



<Admonition type="info" title={"Payload serialization"}>
    You can return any payload that can be serialized as a Buffer with _`Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`_ and deserialized with _`JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`_.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Cost savings on FaaS">
    When running on Function-as-a-Service platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while waiting for the awakeable to be completed.
    Since you only pay for the time that the handler is actually running, your don't pay while waiting for the external process to return.

<Admonition type="info" title="Awaiting awakeables in Virtual Objects">
    Virtual Objects only process a single invocation at a time, so the Virtual Object will be blocked while waiting on the awakeable to be resolved.
