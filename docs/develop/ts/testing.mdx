# Testing

The Typescript SDK has a companion library which makes it easy to test against a Restate container:
[`@restatedev/restate-sdk-testcontainers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-sdk-testcontainers).

## Usage

### Setup
`RestateTestEnvironment.start` creates a Restate container and executes a user-provided closure to register services.
An optional second argument allows you to specify a custom [Testcontainer](https://node.testcontainers.org/) for Restate.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#setup
```

### Calling services
The Restate ingress client can be used as usual (see the [clients documentation](./clients))

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#methods
```

### Checking and mutating state
The `stateOf` method on the `RestateTestEnvironment` class can be used to obtain a handle on the Virtual Object / Workflow state
for a particular key.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#state
```

### Typed state
`stateOf` can be provided with a type for the services state, to allow for type-safe state operations.

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/testing.test.ts#typedstate
```
