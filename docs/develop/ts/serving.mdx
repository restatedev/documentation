# Serving
Restate services can run in two ways: as an HTTP endpoint or as AWS Lambda functions.

## Creating an HTTP endpoint

To create the HTTP endpoint for your services, do the following:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

**1. Define a router for your keyed or unkeyed service**

This router is used to link the function you implemented with an API path. 

For **unkeyed services**, the router looks as follows:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_unkeyed>-<end_unkeyed>
```

This example shows a router for an unkeyed service with three functions and their respective API paths (`hello`, `callMe`, and `maybe`).
This means that the `hello` function can be called via `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/myServicePath/hello`.

The functions of an unkeyed router have two optional parameters:

- A `ctx` of type `restate.Context` which allows to interact with Restate.
- A `request` of type JSON object that represents additional invocation data.

The parameter names may be chosen differently.

For **keyed services**, the router looks as follows:
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_keyed>-<end_keyed>
```

This example shows a router for a keyed service with four functions and their respective API paths (`hello`, `callMe`, `maybe`, and `withSomething`).
This means that the `hello` function can be called via `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/myServicePath/hello`.

The functions of a keyed router have three optional parameters:

- A `ctx` of type `restate.KeyedContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
The `restate.KeyedContext` allows the same operations as the `restate.Context` but is enriched with the extra functionality for keyed services (e.g. access to K/V state).
- A `key` parameter of type string which represents the key of the invoked service.
- A `request` parameter of type JSON object which represents additional invocation data.

The parameter names may be chosen differently.

**2. Export the service API**

You use the exported serviceApi to call this service from within other services (see [service communication docs](/develop/sdk/service-communication))

For unkeyed routers, use the following syntax:
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_unkeyed_api>-<end_unkeyed_api>
```

For keyed routers, use the same syntax:
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_keyed_api>-<end_keyed_api>
```
This means that the `hello` function of this service can be called via `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/myServicePath/hello`.

**3. Create the endpoint**

Create the endpoint. Then, bind the services with `bindRouter` for unkeyed services and `bindKeyedRouter` for keyed services.
You need to supply the service path and router. 
Finally, specify the port of the endpoint (default is `9080`):

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_endpoint>-<end_endpoint>
```

If you need to manually control or customize the HTTP2 server, you can call `http2Handler()` instead of `listen()`, and then use it to manually instantiate the HTTP server:

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_custom_endpoint>-<end_custom_endpoint>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="TypeScript-gRPC">

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts-grpc/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_endpoint>-<end_endpoint>
```

First, call the `endpoint()` method to create a new endpoint.

Then, bind one or multiple services to it:
- As `descriptor`, you need to provide the `protoMetadata` that was generated by the Protobuf code generator. 
- The value assigned to `service` should correspond to the name of the service defined in the Protobuf service definition. This code example assumes the service is called `Greeter`. This means that the Protobuf definition includes the following:
```protobuf
service Greeter {
  // Definition of the methods
  //...
}
```
- For the `instance` field, provide an instance of the service implementation. 

Finally, call `listen(port?)` to specify the port on which the endpoint should listen for connections and requests.

If you need to manually control or customize the HTTP2 server, you can call `http2Handler()` instead of `listen()`, and then use it to manually instantiate the HTTP server:

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts-grpc/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_custom_endpoint>-<end_custom_endpoint>
```
    
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServingHttp.java
```

First, create a `RestateHttpEndpointBuilder`, then bind one or multiple services to the server.

Finally, call `buildAndListen(port)` to have the RestateServer listen on the specified port for connections and requests.

## Creating a Lambda handler

To register your service as a Lambda function,
only minimal changes are required, as compared to the long-running service:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/serving.ts#<start_lambda>-<end_lambda>
```

You can create a Lambda handler in the same way as we did for the [HTTP server](/develop/sdk/serving#creating-an-http-endpoint), but with calling `lambdaHandler()` instead of `listen()`.

Have a look at the [deployment](/deploy/lambda/lambda-typescript) section
for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.

Add the following dependency to your project, for example, using Gradle:

```kotlin
implementation("dev.restate:sdk-lambda:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
```

Register your Lambda services as follows:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServingLambda.java
```

Create a class that extends `BaseRestateLambdaHandler` with your services binded to it.

Have a look at the [deployment](/deploy/lambda/lambda-java) section
for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.

:::info 
That's all you need to do to enable running on AWS Lambda.
The implementation of your service methods remains the same for both deployment options.
