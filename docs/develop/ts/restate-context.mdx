# Restate context

In Restate services, all interaction with the runtime occurs through the Restate context.
This context provides a set of methods that allow you to perform actions such as getting or setting state, or
calling other services.

You can retrieve the context object as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/restate_context.ts
```

The Restate context is supplied as the first argument `ctx` to the handler.
The arguments behind that are optional. For more information about the handler signature, have a look at the [serving docs](/develop/ts/serving).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="TypeScript-gRPC">

For unkeyed routers:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts-grpc/src/develop/restate_context.ts#<start_unkeyed>-<end_unkeyed>
```

For keyed routers:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts-grpc/src/develop/restate_context.ts#<start_keyed>-<end_keyed>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::info
The code blocks in the documentation refer to the Restate Context via the variable named `ctx`.
:::

:::caution 
All method calls made through the Restate context are durably stored in the execution log
and can be replayed in case of failure, ensuring that your service is always reliable and fault-tolerant.
This means that if you do actions (e.g. calling other services, sleep) without making use of the Restate SDK,
you do not have these benefits.
