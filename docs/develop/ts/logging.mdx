# Logging

The Typescript SDK contains an internal logger with filtering based on a level.

The level is set by the `RESTATE_LOGGING` environment variable and the level values can be `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` or `ERROR`.

The default log level is `INFO` if `NODE_ENV=production` is set, otherwise is `DEBUG`.

If you set the level to `TRACE`, you can also get more verbose logging of the journal by setting the environment variable `RESTATE_JOURNAL_LOGGING=TRACE`.

**Console logging**

If you use the default Node console logger, log statements will be printed over and over again during replays.
To avoid this, you can use the Restate context logger, which is a wrapper around the console logger that suppresses duplicate log statements during replays:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/monitoring.ts
```

This logger uses the same level filtering as described above.
