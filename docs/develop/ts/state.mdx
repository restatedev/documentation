# State
You can store key-value state in Restate.
Restate makes sure the state is consistent with the processing of the code execution.

**This feature is only available for Virtual Objects and Workflows:**
- For **Virtual Objects**, the state is isolated per Virtual Object.
- For **Workflows**, you can think of it as if every workflow execution is a new object. So the state is isolated to a single workflow execution. The state can only be mutated by the `run` handler of the workflow. The other handlers can only read the state.

<Admonition type="info" title="Command-line introspection">
    You can inspect and edit the K/V state stored in Restate via `psql` and the CLI.
    Have a look at the [introspection docs](/operate/introspection#inspecting-application-state) for more information.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title={"Serializing state"}>
    You can store any type of value that can be serialized as a Buffer with _`Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`_ and deserialized with _`JSON.parse(result.toString()) as T`_.
</Admonition>

### Listing state keys
For a single Virtual Object, you can list all the state keys that have entries in the state store via:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#statekeys
```

### Retrieving state
<CH.Section>
Use `ctx.get` to retrieve the state for [a key](focus://1[40:53],2[40:53]):
```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#get
```
The return value is `null` if no value was stored.

</CH.Section>

### Setting state
Use `ctx.set` to set a new value for a key:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#set
```

### Clearing state
Use `ctx.clear` to delete the value of a key:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#clear
```

### Clearing all state

Delete all the state stored in Restate for a Virtual Object via:

```typescript
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/state.ts#clear_all
```
