# Service Communication

A handler can call another handler and wait for the response (request-response), or it can send a message without waiting for the response.

<Admonition type="info" title="Exporting the service definition">
Make sure you export the service definition of the service you want to call, as we did in the [service example on the overview page](/develop/ts/overview#services):

<CH.Code lineNumbers={"true"} rows={"focus"} >

    ```typescript focus=12
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/my_service.ts
    ```

</CH.Code>

Import this service definition in the service handler that wants to call it.
</Admonition>

## Request-response calls

Request-response calls are requests where the client waits for the response.

<CH.Code>

```ts call_service.ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_request_response_service>-<end_request_response_service>
```

---

```ts call_object.ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_request_response_object>-<end_request_response_object>
```

</CH.Code>

1. **Create a service client** and supply the service definition of the service you want to call.
   For Virtual Objects, you also need to supply the key of the Virtual Object you want to call, here `"Mary"`.
2. **Specify the handler** you want to call and supply the request.
3. **Await** the call to retrieve the response.

<Admonition type="tip" title="No need for manual retry logic">
    These calls are proxied by Restate, and get logged in the journal.
    In case of failures, Restate takes care of retries.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type={"caution"} title={"Deadlocks with Virtual Objects"}>

    Request-response calls to Virtual Object can lead to deadlocks.
    When this happens, the Virtual Object remains locked and the system can't process any more requests.
    In this situation you'll have to unblock the Virtual Object manually by [cancelling invocations](/operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations). Some example cases:
    - Cross deadlock between Virtual Object A and B: A calls B, and B calls A, both using same keys.
    - Cyclical deadlock: A calls B, and B calls C, and C calls A again.

</Admonition>

## Sending messages

Handlers can send messages (a.k.a. one-way calls, or fire-and-forget calls), as follows:

<CH.Code>

```ts call_service.ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_one_way_service>-<end_one_way_service>
```

    ---

```ts call_object.ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_one_way_object>-<end_one_way_object>
```

</CH.Code>

<Admonition type="tip" title="No need for message queues">
    Without Restate, you would usually put a message queue in between the two services, to guarantee the message delivery.
    Restate eliminates the need for a message queue because Restate durably logs the request and makes sure it gets executed.
</Admonition>

## Delayed calls

A delayed call is a one-way call that gets executed after a specified delay.

To schedule a delayed call, send a message with a delay parameter, as follows:

<CH.Code>

```ts call_service.ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_delayed_service>-<end_delayed_service>
```

    ---

```ts call_object.ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_delayed_object>-<end_delayed_object>
```

</CH.Code>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Scheduling async tasks">
    You can also use this functionality to schedule async tasks.
    Restate will make sure the task gets executed at the desired time.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Ordering guarantees in Virtual Objects">
    <CH.Section>
    Invocations to a Virtual Object are executed serially.
    Invocations will execute in the same order in which they arrive at Restate.
    For example, assume a handler calls the same Virtual Object twice:

        <CH.Code lineNumbers={"true"}>
            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/service_communication.ts#<start_ordering>-<end_ordering>
            ```
        </CH.Code>

    It is guaranteed that [the invocation on line `1`](focus://1) will execute before [the invocation on line `2`](focus://2).
    It is not guaranteed though that [invocation `2`](focus://2) will be executed immediately after [invocation `1`](focus://1), as invocations coming from other handlers/sources, could interleave these two calls.
    </CH.Section>

</Admonition>
