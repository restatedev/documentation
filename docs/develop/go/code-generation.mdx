# Code generation

The Go SDK supports generating typed clients and server interfaces from
[Protocol Buffer service definitions](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#services).
A full example can be found in the [SDK repository](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-go/tree/main/examples/codegen).

Code generation relies on the tool `protoc-gen-go-restate` which you can install using
`go install github.com/restatedev/sdk-go/protoc-gen-go-restate@latest`, in addition to `protoc`
which you can install from the [Protobuf compiler repo](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-compiler-installation).

## Defining a service

To get started, create a Protocol Buffer definition file defining a service:

```proto
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/codegen/proto/service.proto#service
```

You can compile this file into Go types and your Restate generated code with:

```shell
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-restate_out=. --go-restate_opt=paths=source_relative proto/service.proto
```

This creates two files: `service.pb.go` containing Go types, and `service_restate.pb.go` which contains several useful objects:
1. `NewGreeterClient`, which returns an interface for making type-safe calls to the Greeter service. The default serialization
   for request and response data is the [canonical Protobuf JSON encoding](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json),
   but this is configurable.
2. `GreeterServer`, an interface for server code to implement. An implementor can be converted into a service definition with
   `NewGreeterServer`.
3. `UnimplementedGreeterServer`, an empty struct that implements `GreeterServer` by just returning 'not implemented' terminal
   errors for each method. You can choose to embed this struct into your own implementation struct, in which case new methods
   in the Protobuf definition will not cause compilation errors in your Go code, which can help with backwards compatibility.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Want to use different serialization?">
    Both `NewGreeterClient` and `NewGreeterServer` accept option parameters which can be used to set a different serialization codec.
    For example, you can use Protobuf by providing `restate.WithProto` to both functions.
</Admonition>

## Implementing the server

Next, you can implement the `GreeterServer` interface and bind it to your Restate server.

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/codegen/codegen.go#server
```

## Using the client

`NewGreeterClient` will return a similar client to what you'd get from `restate.Service`, with additional
type safety for method names and request/response types.

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/codegen/codegen.go#client
```

## Defining Virtual Objects

To define a Virtual Object, you will need to provide the option `dev.restate.sdk.go.service_type` when defining the service.
This option is defined by the Go SDK's proto file
[`dev/restate/sdk/go.proto`](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-go/blob/main/proto/dev/restate/sdk/go.proto) which must be imported in your own file,
and a directory containing it must be provided to protoc eg with `-I $GOPATH/src/github.com/restatedev/sdk-go/proto`

You may additionally provide the option `dev.restate.sdk.go.handler_type` to denote that a handler only needs access to the `ObjectSharedContext` and can run
concurrently with other handlers.

```proto
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/codegen/proto/service.proto#virtual_object
```

Virtual Object clients are instantiated with a key:
```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/codegen/codegen.go#virtual_object_client
```

    <summary>Easier Protobuf with Buf</summary>

    Instead of manually wrangling `protoc` to handle generation and proto imports,
    it can be a lot easier to use [Buf](https://buf.build/).

    Buf determines what code to generate based on a `buf.gen.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    version: v2
    managed:
      enabled: true
    plugins:
      - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.34.2
        out: .
        opt: paths=source_relative
      - local: protoc-gen-go-restate
        out: .
        opt: paths=source_relative
    inputs:
      - directory: .
    ```

    And to allow the import of `dev/restate/sdk/go.proto`, you can specify the dependency in your `buf.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    version: v2
    lint:
      use:
        - DEFAULT
    breaking:
      use:
        - FILE
    deps:
      - buf.build/restatedev/sdk-go
    ```

    Then you can run `buf generate` to generate the code.
