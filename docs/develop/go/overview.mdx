# Overview

The Restate Go SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-go repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-go)).

Add the `github.com/restatedev/sdk-go` dependency to your project to start developing Restate services.

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1), or a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services

[Services](/concepts/services#services-1) and their handlers are defined as follows:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/myservice/main.go
```

- Define a Service by implementing exported methods on any struct.
- By default, the service name is the name of the struct, so the service can be
  called at `<RESTATE_INGRESS_URL>/MyService/MyHandler`.
- The service definition contains a list of handlers.
  Each handler is just a function that implements the handler logic. The handler
  will be named the same way as the method.
  The function has the Restate Context as its first argument.
  Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
  The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
- The handler input parameter (at most one) and return type can be of any type, as long as
  they can be serialized. By default, serialization is done with
  [`JSONCodec`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/restatedev/sdk-go/encoding#PayloadCodec)
  which uses `encoding/json`. If you don't need to accept or return anything,
  you can use `restate.Void{}` which skips (de)serialization.
- Pass the `MyService` struct to `restate.Service` which uses reflection to turn
  the methods into handlers. It will skip unexported methods and those that
  don't have the expected signature.
- Finally, create a server listening on the specified address and bind the
  service(s) to it.

## Virtual Objects

[Virtual Objects](/concepts/services#virtual-objects) and their handlers are defined similarly to services, with the following differences:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/myvirtualobject/main.go
```

- We pass the struct to `restate.Object` instead of `restate.Service`.
- The first argument of each handler must be the `ObjectContext` parameter.
Handlers with the `ObjectContext` parameter can write to the K/V state store.
Only one handler can be active at a time, to ensure consistency.
- If you want to have a handler that executes concurrently to the others and
doesn't have write access to the K/V state, instead use the
`ObjectSharedContext`. For example, you can use these handlers to read K/V
state, or interact with the blocking handler.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Prefer a bit more type-safety?">
    The Go SDK also supports defining handlers and input/output types using
    code generation from [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/). See
    [Code Generation](code-generation.mdx) for more details.

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's have a look at what the Restate Context allows you to do.
