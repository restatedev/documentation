# State
You can store key-value state in Restate.
Restate makes sure the state is consistent with the processing of the code execution.

**This feature is only available for Virtual Objects:**
- For **Virtual Objects**, the state is isolated per Virtual Object and lives forever (across invocations for that object).

<Admonition type="info" title="Command-line introspection">
    You can inspect and edit the K/V state stored in Restate via `psql` and the CLI.
    Have a look at the [introspection docs](/operate/introspection#inspecting-application-state) for more information.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title={"Serializing state"}>
    You can store any type of value that can be serialized. By default, serialization is done with
    [`JSONCodec`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/restatedev/sdk-go/encoding#PayloadCodec)
    which uses `encoding/json`.
</Admonition>

### Listing state keys
For a single Virtual Object, you can list all the state keys that have entries in the state store via:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/state.go#statekeys
```

### Retrieving state
Use `restate.Get` to retrieve the state for a key:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/state.go#get
```

The zero value will be returned if a state value does not exist for the provided key.

### Setting state
Use `restate.Set` to set a new value for a key:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/state.go#set
```

This function will only return errors in the case of failed serialization.

### Clearing state
Use `restate.Clear` to delete the value of a key:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/state.go#clear
```

### Clearing all state

Delete all the state stored in Restate for a Virtual Object via:

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/state.go#clear_all
```
