# Service Communication

A handler can call another handler and wait for the response (request-response), or it can send a message without waiting for the response.

## Request-response calls

Request-response calls are requests where the client waits for the response.

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"single-item"}>

    To a Service:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#request_response_service
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>
<CH.Scrollycoding className={"single-item"}>

    To a Virtual Object:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#request_response_object
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

1. **Create a service client** and supply the name of the service and method you want to call, as well
  as a type parameter for the output type.
  For Virtual Objects, you also need to supply the key of the Virtual Object you want to call, here `"Mary"`.
2. **Call Request()** with the input data to make a synchronous request which will block on the response.

<Admonition type="tip" title="No need for manual retry logic">
    These calls are proxied by Restate, and get logged in the journal.
    In case of failures, Restate takes care of retries.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Prefer a bit more type-safety?">
    The Go SDK also supports defining handlers and input/output types using
    code generation from [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/). This will
    also generate typed clients which can be used to safely call other methods. See [Code Generation](code-generation.mdx) for more details.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type={"caution"} title={"Deadlocks with Virtual Objects"}>
    Request-response calls to Virtual Objects can lead to deadlocks, in which the Virtual Object remains locked and can't process any more requests.
    Some example cases:
    - Cross deadlock between Virtual Object A and B: A calls B, and B calls A, both using same keys.
    - Cyclical deadlock: A calls B, and B calls C, and C calls A again.

    In this situation, you can use the CLI to unblock the Virtual Object manually by [cancelling invocations](/operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations).
</Admonition>

## Sending messages

Handlers can send messages (a.k.a. one-way calls, or fire-and-forget calls), as follows:

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"single-item"}>

    To a Service:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#one_way_service
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"single-item"}>

    To a Virtual Object:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#one_way_object
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<Admonition type="tip" title="No need for message queues">
    Without Restate, you would usually put a message queue in between the two services, to guarantee the message delivery.
    Restate eliminates the need for a message queue because Restate durably logs the request and makes sure it gets executed.
</Admonition>

## Delayed calls

A delayed call is a one-way call that gets executed after a specified delay.

To schedule a delayed call, send a message with a delay parameter, as follows:

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"single-item"}>

    To a Service:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#delayed_service
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>
<CH.Scrollycoding className={"single-item"}>

    To a Virtual Object:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#delayed_object
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Scheduling async tasks">
    You can also use this functionality to schedule async tasks.
    Restate will make sure the task gets executed at the desired time.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Ordering guarantees in Virtual Objects">
    Invocations to a Virtual Object are executed serially.
    Invocations will execute in the same order in which they arrive at Restate.
    For example, assume a handler calls the same Virtual Object twice:

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servicecommunication.go#ordering
    ```

    It is guaranteed that call A will execute before call B.
    It is not guaranteed though that call B will be executed immediately after call A, as invocations coming from other handlers/sources, could interleave these two calls.
