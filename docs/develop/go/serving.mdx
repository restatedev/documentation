# Serving
The Restate SDK is served as a HTTP handler. You can choose to run this in a
standalone HTTP2 server, or connect the handler into a FaaS system like Lambda.

## Creating a HTTP2 server
1. Create the Restate Server
2. Bind one or multiple services to it.
3. Listen on the specified port for connections and requests.

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/serving.go#endpoint
```

<details className={"grey-details"}>
    <summary>Customizing the HTTP2 server</summary>

    If you need to customize the HTTP2 server, or serve over HTTP1.1
    you can call `.Handler()` instead of `Start()`, and then use the
    handler as normal. To discover services over HTTP1.1 you must
    provide the `--use-http1.1` CLI flag.

    ```go
    CODE_LOAD::go/develop/serving.go#custom_endpoint
    ```

    By default, this handler will advertise itself as working
    bidirectionally; the SDK will try to get completions from the runtime
    during execution.

    However, you can use the method `.Bidirectional(false)` on the endpoint
    builder to change this on platforms that do not support bidirectional
    communication, such as Lambda. If you don't do this your handler may get
    stuck.
</details>

## Creating a Lambda handler

To register your service as a Lambda function change the endpoint into a Lambda handler,
setting `.Bidirectional(false)` as Lambda does not support bidirectional streaming
of request data.
```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/servinglambda.go#lambda
```

Have a look at the [deployment section](/category/aws--aws-lambda)
for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.

<Admonition type="tip" title={"Run on Lambda without handler changes"}>
    The implementation of your services and handlers remains the same for both deployment options.
</Admonition>

## Validating request identity

SDKs can validate that incoming requests come from a particular Restate
instance. You can find out more about request identity in the [Security docs](/operate/security#locking-down-service-access)

```go
CODE_LOAD::go/develop/serving.go#identity
```
