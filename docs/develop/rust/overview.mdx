# Overview

The Restate Rust SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-rust repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-rust)).

<Admonition type="info" icon="ðŸš§" title="Work in progress">
The Rust SDK documentation is still under construction. Please refer to the [Rust hello-world template](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/templates/rust) and the [`restate-sdk` crate docs](https://docs.rs/restate-sdk/latest/restate_sdk/) to get started.
