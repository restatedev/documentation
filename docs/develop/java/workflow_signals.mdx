# Workflow Signals

You can use signals to interact with your running workflows.

You can use them to let the workflow block until an event occurs, or to send a signal / information to a running workflow.

You can implement signals via the Durable Promises feature of the SDK.
This allows you to create a promise in your `run` handler that is durable and distributed.
This promise can be resolved or rejected by any other handler in the workflow.

```java

```

<Admonition type={"note"} title={"Lifecycle of Restate's Durable Promises"}>
A Durable Promise can only be resolved or rejected while the workflow's `run` handler is running.
The lifetime of the Promise is tied to the execution time of the `run` handler.
