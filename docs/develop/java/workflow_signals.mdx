# Workflow Signals

**This feature only works for services of the Workflow type.**

You can use signals to interact with your running workflows.

You can use them to let the workflow block until an event occurs, or to send a signal / information to a running workflow.

You can implement signals via the Durable Promises feature of the SDK.
These promises are durable and distributed, meaning they survive crashes and can be resolved or rejected by any handler in the workflow.

Do the following:
1. Create a promise in your `run` handler that is durable and distributed
2. Resolve or reject the promise in any other handler in the workflow.

<Admonition type={"note"} title={"Lifecycle of Restate's Durable Promises"}>
A Durable Promise can only be resolved or rejected while the workflow's `run` handler is running.
The lifetime of the Promise is tied to the execution time of the `run` handler.
