# Determinism & side effects

Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
For this to work, the user code needs to be deterministic.
To help you with keeping code execution deterministic, the SDK has a few built-in functions:
1. **Side effects**: For all other non-deterministic code, you need to use side effects, as explained [below](/develop/java/side-effects#side-effects).
2. **Promise/awaitable combinators**: Check the built-in helper functions [listed below](/develop/java/side-effects#promise-awaitable-combinators).
3. **Random generators:** For example UUIDs and random numbers. Check the built-in helper functions [listed below](/develop/java/side-effects#built-in-helper-functions).


## Side effects
Side effects help relaxing the constraints on determinism.
If your code does something that is non-deterministic, then you have to wrap it in a side effect.
By doing this, Restate makes sure that the result is persistently stored in the execution log
and that the value is retained during replays.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string return value is stored as a side effect in Restate:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_side_effect>-<end_side_effect>
```

In order for `run` to work, the Restate SDK needs to know how to serialize and deserialize it.
For the primitive types, you can use Restate's built-in `dev.restate.sdk.core.CoreSerdes`, for example `CoreSerdes.STRING_UTF8` or `CoreSerdes.BOOLEAN`.
For more information, have a look at the documentation on [serialization](/develop/java/serialization).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_side_effect>-<end_side_effect>
```

In order for `runBlock` to work, the Restate SDK needs to know how to serialize and deserialize it.
By default, Kotlin serialization is used, but you can override it with your own (de)serialization tools.
For more information, have a look at the documentation on [serialization](/develop/java/serialization).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once stored, the request to the database will not get re-executed upon replay, but the first result will be used instead.

<Admonition type="note">
You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a side effect!
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting side effects.
</Admonition>

### Retrying on failure

If the side effect closure throws an error, then it is retried infinitely using an exponential backoff strategy until it succeeds.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_retry_settings>-<end_retry_settings>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_retry_settings>-<end_retry_settings>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Terminal failures of side effects

By default, a side effect function is retried infinitely on failure.
If you want to let the side effect fail terminally, then you have to throw a terminal error.
A terminal error will stop the infinite retry strategy and lets the SDK propagate the error to the user code where it can be handled.
The terminal error will also be recorded in the journal so that it will be deterministically thrown on replay.

You can throw a terminal exception via `TerminalException` and supply it with a `TerminalException.Code` and a message:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_terminal>-<end_terminal>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_terminal>-<end_terminal>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Promise/Awaitable combinators

The SDK provides combinators for working with `Awaitable`.

**Await all**

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_combine_all>-<end_combine_all>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_combine_all>-<end_combine_all>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Creates an `Awaitable` that awaits all of the provided Awaitables to resolve.

The semantics are similar to [`CompleteableFuture.allOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#allOf(java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture...)), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

**Await any**

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_combine_any>-<end_combine_any>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_combine_any>-<end_combine_any>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Creates an `Awaitable` that awaits any of the provided Awaitables to resolve.

The semantics are similar to [`CompleteableFuture.anyOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#anyOf(java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture...)), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

## Built-in helper functions
Two common non-deterministic actions are the generation of UUIDs and random numbers.
The SDK provides helper functions for those.

### Generating UUIDs

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_uuid>-<end_uuid>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_uuid>-<end_uuid>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="note">
`ctx.random()` returns a `RestateRandom` instance. This is a subclass of built-in's `Random` that seeds it on the invocation ID, to always return the same value on retries.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="caution">
Do not use this in cryptographic contexts.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">
You can use this to generate stable idempotency keys with one line of code.
For example, imagine a payment service where you want to avoid having duplicate payments during retries.
You could use this utility to generate a UUID and then use that UUID as identifier of the payment.
You only allow the payment to go through if no payment with that UUID was done yet.
Restate guarantees that once the UUID is stored, it is retained during retries.
</Admonition>

### Generating random numbers

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/SideEffects.java#<start_random_nb>-<end_random_nb>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/SideEffects.kt#<start_random_nb>-<end_random_nb>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use any of the methods of [`java.util.Random`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) to generate random numbers: for example, `nextBoolean()`, `nextLong()`, `nextFloat()`, etc.

<Admonition type="note">
`ctx.random()` returns a `RestateRandom` instance. This is a subclass of built-in's `Random` that seeds it on the invocation ID, to always return the same value on retries.
