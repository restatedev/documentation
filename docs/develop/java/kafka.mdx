# Kafka

Restate can consume events directly from Kafka. To do that, you need to:

* Develop an event handler, to consume events within your Restate service
* Deploy Restate with the configuration to connect to a Kafka cluster
* Wire up an event handler with a Kafka topic through a subscription

## Event handler

An event handlers is alike any other handler in your services/virtual objects, and profit from the same features, including durable execution, [service communication](/develop/java/service-communication) and [side effects](/develop/java/side-effects).

**Handling keyed events within virtual objects**

You can handle events within virtual objects, where the key of the Kafka record matches the object key.

Event handlers are no different from regular handlers, and the event payload will be (de)serialized as JSON:

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/MyKafkaVirtualObject.java
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/MyKafkaVirtualObject.kt
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Combining RPC and Kafka within a service">
You can mix methods receiving events with regular RPC methods. For example, assume you're implementing a `Profile` service to handle and store user profiles in Restate, where the key is the profile's unique identifier.
In the same service, you can implement an RPC `get` method to retrieve the profile, and you can attach an `updateProfile` event handler to consume events from Kafka to update the profile.
</Admonition>

For each event key (= Kafka record key), the events are delivered in the order in which they arrived on the topic partition.

**Handling events within services**

You can also handle events within services. In this case, events are delivered in parallel without ordering guarantees.

## Event metadata

Each event carries within the `ctx.request().headers()` map the following entries:

* `restate.subscription.id`: The subscription identifier, as shown by the [Admin API](../../references/admin-api).
* `kafka.offset`: The record offset.
* `kafka.partition`: The record partition.
* `kafka.timestamp`: The record timestamp.

## Configure Kafka clusters when deploying Restate

To connect to a Kafka topic, you must configure the Kafka cluster to connect to.

You can define Kafka clusters in the [Restate configuration file](/operate/configuration#configuration-file):

```toml
[[ingress.kafka-clusters]]
name = "my-cluster"
brokers = ["PLAINTEXT://broker:9092"]
```

Check the [configuration documentation](/operate/configuration) for more details.

## Connect an event handler with a topic

To connect event handlers to a Kafka topic, you need to create a subscription using the [Admin API](/references/admin-api):

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source": "kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>", "sink": "component://<COMPONENT_NAME>/<METHOD_NAME>"}'
```

For example:

```bash
curl localhost:9070/subscriptions \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"source": "kafka://my-cluster/my-topic", "sink": "component://MyService/Handle"}'
```

Once you've created a subscription, Restate immediately starts consuming events from Kafka.

### Additional subscription configuration

You can add additional configuration parameters to the subscription through the `options` field, for example to start consuming the topic from the beginning:

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source": "kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>", "sink": "component://<COMPONENT_NAME>/<METHOD_NAME>", "options": {"auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}}'
```

The `options` field accepts any configuration parameter from [librdkafka configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md).

### Listing subscriptions

List the current subscriptions via:

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions
```

For example:

```bash
curl localhost:9070/subscriptions
```

### Deleting a subscription

The creation and listing of subscriptions returns an identifier. You can use this identifier to delete a subscription:

```bash
curl -X DELETE <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_IDENTIFIER>
```

For example:

```bash
curl -X DELETE localhost:9070/subscriptions/018cd978aa9f77b5a80454bc060c2a77
```

When you delete a subscription, Restate stops the consumer group associated to it.

<Admonition type="info">
Once you delete the subscription, there might still be messages enqueued in Restate to be processed by the subscriber service. This behaviour might change in next releases.
