# Awakeables

Awakeables pause an invocation while waiting for another process to complete a task.
You can use this pattern to let a handler execute a task somewhere else and retrieve the result.
This pattern is also known as the callback (task token) pattern.

        </CH.Code>

        1. [The handler **creates an awakeable**](focus://1,2). This contains a [String identifier](focus://2) and a Promise/Awaitable.
        2. [The handler **triggers a task/process** and attaches the awakeable ID](focus://4)  (e.g. over Kafka, via HTTP,...).
            For example, send an HTTP request to a service that executes the task, and attach the ID to the payload.
            You use `ctx.run` to avoid retriggering the task this on retries.
        3. [The handler **waits** until the other process has executed the task.](focus://6)

    4. **The external process completes the awakeable** when the task is finished by:

        5. Once the ID has been returned to the service, the **invocation resumes**.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Cost savings on FaaS">
When running on Function-as-a-Service platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while waiting for the awakeable to be completed.
Since you only pay for the time that the handler is actually running, your don't pay while waiting for the external process to return.

<Admonition type="info" title="Awaiting awakeables in Virtual Objects">
    Virtual Objects only process a single invocation at a time, so the Virtual Object will be blocked while waiting on the awakeable to be resolved.
