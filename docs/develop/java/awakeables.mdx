# Awakeables

Awakeables pause an invocation while waiting for another process to complete a task.
You can use this pattern to let a handler execute a task somewhere else and retrieve the result.
This pattern is also known as the callback (task token) pattern.

        1. [**Create an awakeable**](focus://MyHandler.java#1,2). This contains a [String identifier](focus://2) and a Promise/Awaitable.
        2. [**Trigger a task/process** and attach the awakeable ID](focus://MyHandler.java#4)  (e.g. over Kafka, via HTTP,...).
        For example, send an HTTP request to a service that executes the task, and attach the ID to the payload.
            You use `ctx.run` to avoid retriggering the task this on retries.
        3. [**Wait** until the other process has executed the task.](focus://MyHandler.java#6)
        4. Once the process has finished, it **completes the awakeable**. It does this by calling into Restate and returning the ID. It either:
            - **Resolves** the awakeable (success) with its ID and an optional payload
                - [Via the SDK](focus://ResolveWithSDK.java#1:2)
                - [Over HTTP](focus://resolve_with_curl.sh#1:2)
            - **Rejects** the awakeable (failure) with its ID and a reason. This will throw [a terminal error](/develop/java/error-handling) in the waiting handler.
                - [Via the SDK](focus://RejectWithSDK.java#1:2)
                - [Over HTTP](focus://reject_with_curl.sh#1:2)
        5. Once the ID has been returned to the service, the **invocation resumes**.

<Admonition type="tip" icon={"💡"} title="Cost savings on FaaS">
When running on Function-as-a-Service platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Restate suspends the handler while waiting for the awakeable to be resolved.
Since you only pay for the time that the handler is actually running, your don't pay while waiting for the external process to complete.

<Admonition type="info" title="Awaiting awakeables in Virtual Objects">
    Virtual Objects only process a single invocation at a time, so the Virtual Object will be blocked while sleeping.
