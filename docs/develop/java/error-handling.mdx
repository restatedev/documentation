# Error Handling

Restate handles retries for failed invocations.
By default, Restate does infinite retries with an exponential backoff strategy.

For situations where you do not want the invocation to be retried, but instead want the error message
to be propagated back to the caller, you can use a **terminal error**.

From within a handler, you can throw a terminal exception with an HTTP status code and a message, as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ErrorHandling.java
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ErrorHandling.kt
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can catch terminal exceptions. For example, you can catch the terminal exception that comes out of a [call to another service](/develop/java/service-communication#request-response-calls), and build your control flow around it.

You can throw a terminal error anywhere in your handler.
Restate will propagate the error code and message back to the caller and will consider this invocation to be finished.
