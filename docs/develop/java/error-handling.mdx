# Error handling

Restate takes care of retries of failed invocations. 
It does this for all kinds of errors, such as transient network errors and errors thrown inside handlers. 
By default, Restate does infinite retries with an exponential backoff strategy.

For situations where you do not want the invocation to be retried, but instead you want the error message
to be propagated back to the caller, you can use a terminal error.

You can throw a terminal exception with a `TerminalException.Code` and a message, as follows:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ErrorHandling.java
```

:::note Errors during side effect execution
Throwing errors inside a side effect has the same semantics as anywhere else in your handler code.
By default, Restate infinitely retries the invocation, and therefore the side effect.
Errors that should not be retried, should be thrown as terminal errors, as described earlier.
Invocation retries are triggered by Restate, not by the SDKs.
:::

You can catch terminal exceptions. For example, you can catch the terminal exception that comes out of a [call to another service](/develop/java/service-communication#request-response-calls), and build your control flow around it.

You can throw a terminal error anywhere in your handler.
Restate will propagate the error code and message back to the caller and will consider this invocation to be finished.
