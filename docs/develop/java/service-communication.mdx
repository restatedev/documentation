# Service communication
A Restate service can call another service without waiting for the response (one-way call) or with waiting for the response (request-response).

## Request-response calls
Request-response calls are requests where the client waits for the response.

Let's assume we have a `Greeter` service running next to the service we are currently developing.
This `Greeter` service has a method called `Greet` that takes an input request containing a `name` as a `string`.
To make request-response calls to the `Greeter` service, do the following:

Use Restate's generated clients to do the call.
For example, if you have a `Greeter` service with a method `greet`:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_request_response>-<end_request_response>
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: vanilla gRPC</summary>

You can do request-response calls via `ctx.call` by supplying it with the gRPC method descriptor and request, by using the generated Protobuf code.
In this example, the `Greet` function requires a `Request` Protobuf message as input with a single `name` parameter.

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_grpc_request_response>-<end_grpc_request_response>
```

</details>

The Restate SDK sends these requests to Restate, that logs them in the Restate journal.
And in case of failures, Restate takes care of retries.


## One-way calls
A one-way call is a call from one service to another service where the client does not wait for a response, sometimes also called fire-and-forget.
Without Restate, this is usually implemented by adding a message queue in between the two services. 
Restate eliminates the need for a message queue because Restate durably logs the request and makes sure it gets executed.

Use Restate's generated clients to do the call.
For example, if you have a `Greeter` service with a method `greet`:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_one_way>-<end_one_way>
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: vanilla gRPC</summary>

You can do one-way calls via `ctx.oneWayCall` by supplying it with the gRPC method descriptor and request, by using the generated Protobuf code.
In this example, the `Greet` function requires a `Request` Protobuf message as input with a single `name` parameter.

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_grpc_one_way>-<end_grpc_one_way>
```

</details>


## Delayed calls
A delayed call is a one-way call that gets executed after a specified delay.
Use Restate's generated clients to do the call.
For example, if you have a `Greeter` service with a method `greet`:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_delayed>-<end_delayed>
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: vanilla gRPC</summary>

You can do delayed calls via `ctx.delayedCall` by supplying it with the gRPC method descriptor and request, by using the generated Protobuf code.
In this example, the `Greet` function requires a `Request` Protobuf message as input with a single `name` parameter.

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_grpc_delayed>-<end_grpc_delayed>
```

</details>

Restate takes care of the scheduling and the durability of the delayed call.
