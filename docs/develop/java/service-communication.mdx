# Service Communication
A handler can call another handler and wait for the response (request-response), or it can send a message without waiting for the response.

## Request-response calls

Request-response calls are requests where the client waits for the response.
The Java SDK generates a client for each service, which you can use to make these calls.

<Admonition type="info" title={"Generating the clients"}>
    The clients are generated when you build the project. If you don't see the generated clients, make sure you have built the project with `./gradlew build`.
</Admonition>

Use the generated client's of the SDK to do the request-response call:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString className={"display-none"}>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

             To a Service:

             ```java
             CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#request_response_service
             ```


             To a Virtual Object:

             ```java
             CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#request_response_virtual_object
             ```

             To a Workflow:
             ```java
             CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#request_response_workflow
             ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
            To a Service:

            ```kotlin
            CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#request_response_service
            ```

         To a Virtual Object:

            ```kotlin
            CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#request_response_virtual_object
            ```

            To a Workflow:

            ```kotlin CallWorkflow.kt
            CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#request_response_workflow
            ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="No need for manual retry logic">
    These calls are proxied by Restate, and get logged in the journal.
    In case of failures, Restate takes care of retries.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Workflow retention time">
    Once the `run` handler of the workflow has finished, the other handlers can still be called up to the retention time of the workflow, by default 24 hours.
    This can be configured via the [Admin API](/references/admin-api/#tag/service/operation/modify_service) per Workflow definition by setting `workflow_completion_retention`.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type={"caution"} title={"Deadlocks with Virtual Objects"}>
Request-response calls to Virtual Object can lead to deadlocks.
When this happens, the Virtual Object remains locked and the system can't process any more requests.
In this situation you'll have to unblock the Virtual Object manually by [cancelling invocations](/operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations). Some example cases:
- Cross deadlock between Virtual Object A and B: A calls B, and B calls A, both using same keys.
- Cyclical deadlock: A calls B, and B calls C, and C calls A again.
</Admonition>

## Sending messages
Handlers can send messages (a.k.a. one-way calls, or fire-and-forget calls).
Use the client's `.send()` method to do this as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#one_way
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#one_way
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="No need for message queues">
    Without Restate, you would usually put a message queue in between the two services, to guarantee the message delivery.
    Restate eliminates the need for a message queue because Restate durably logs the request and makes sure it gets executed.
</Admonition>

## Delayed calls
A delayed call is a one-way call that gets executed after a specified delay.

Use Restate's generated clients `.send(Duration)` method to send a delayed requests:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#delayed
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#delayed
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Scheduling async tasks">
You can also use this functionality to schedule async tasks.
Restate will make sure the task gets executed at the desired time.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Ordering guarantees in Virtual Objects">

    Invocations to a Virtual Object are executed serially.
    Invocations will execute in the same order in which they arrive at Restate.
    For example, assume the following code in `ServiceA`:

    ```java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#ordering
    ```

    It is guaranteed that call A will execute before call B.
    It is not guaranteed though that call B will be executed immediately after call A, as invocations coming from other handlers/sources, could interleave these two calls.
