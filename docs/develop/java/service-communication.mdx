# Service communication
A Restate service can call another service without waiting for the response (one-way call) or with waiting for the response (request-response).

## Request-response calls
Request-response calls are requests where the client waits for the response.

To make request-response calls to services, you can use the generated clients:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_request_response_service>-<end_request_response_service>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#<start_request_response_service>-<end_request_response_service>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To make request-response calls to virtual objects, you also need to pass the object key to the client factory method:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_request_response_virtual_object>-<end_request_response_virtual_object>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#<start_request_response_virtual_object>-<end_request_response_virtual_object>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Restate SDK sends these requests to Restate, that logs them in the Restate journal.
And in case of failures, Restate takes care of retries.

## One-way calls
A one-way call is a call from one service to another service where the client does not wait for a response, sometimes also called fire-and-forget.
Without Restate, this is usually implemented by adding a message queue in between the two services.
Restate eliminates the need for a message queue because Restate durably logs the request and makes sure it gets executed.

Use Restate's generated clients `.send()` method to create a client variant for send requests:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_one_way>-<end_one_way>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#<start_one_way>-<end_one_way>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Delayed calls
A delayed call is a one-way call that gets executed after a specified delay.

Use Restate's generated clients `.send(Duration)` method to create a client variant for delayed send requests:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServiceCommunication.java#<start_delayed>-<end_delayed>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/ServiceCommunication.kt#<start_delayed>-<end_delayed>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Restate takes care of the scheduling and the durability of the delayed call.
