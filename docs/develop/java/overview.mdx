# Overview

The Restate Java SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-java repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-java)).

## Installation

:::tip
Have a look at the [Java Quickstart](/get_started/quickstart?sdk=jvm)!
:::

Scaffold a project using the build tool of your choice. For example, with Gradle (Kotlin script):

```shell
gradle init --type java-application
```

Add the dependency `sdk-api`:

```kotlin
implementation("dev.restate:sdk-api:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
```

Depending on the deployment target, add one of the following dependencies:
- To run as long-running app: `dev.restate:sdk-http-vertx:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION`
- To run on AWS Lambda: `dev.restate:sdk-lambda:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION`

To use Jackson for serialization, add the following dependency: `dev.restate:sdk-serde-jackson:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION`

Now you need to configure the protobuf plugin to build your Protobuf contracts.
Have a look at the [`build.gradle.kts` file of the Java Gradle template](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/blob/main/templates/java-gradle/build.gradle.kts) for an example.

For Maven, you can use the [xolstice Protobuf plugin](https://www.xolstice.org/protobuf-maven-plugin/index.html).

## API Examples

Below is an example of a Java service. 

Restate uses [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) to define the service and its methods. The example shows a greeter service with a single method:
- `greet`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name, and prints a greeting.

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/Greeter.java
```

The `Greeter` class extends `GreeterRestate.GreeterRestateImplBase`, which is the base generated by the Restate protoc generator.
It has the name of the service (`Greeter`) with `Restate` appended to it.

The [Restate context](/develop/sdk/restate-context) is supplied to the method as the first argument.
The context enables interaction with Restate (e.g. calling other services, setting timers).
The `greet` method uses an ObjectContext since it is a keyed service. For unkeyed services, use `Context`.
Finally, the Restate server is set up to serve both methods of the greeter service.

This is what corresponding Protobuf definition would look like for this service:

```protobuf
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/proto/greeter.proto
```

To understand the Restate-specific parts of this Protobuf definition, have a look at the documentation [here](/develop/service_type#restate-service-contract).

<details>
<summary>Alternative: vanilla gRPC</summary>

Restate's proto code generator makes the generated code more polished for writing Restate services.
However, it is also possible to use the vanilla generated protobuf code by `protoc-gen-grpc-java`, in case you prefer this.

An example:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/GreeterVanillaGrpc.java
```

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's dive into the details!
