# Overview

The Restate Java/Kotlin SDK is open source and can be found on GitHub: ([sdk-java repo](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-java)).

<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸš€" title="Set up your project in seconds">
Have a look at the quickstart for [Java](/get_started/quickstart?sdk=java) or [Kotlin](/get_started/quickstart?sdk=kotlin)!
</Admonition>

The Restate SDK lets you implement handlers.
Handlers can either be part of a [Service](/concepts/services#services-1), a [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects), or a [Workflow](/develop/java/overview#workflows). Let's have a look at how to define them.

## Services
[Services](/concepts/services#services-1) and their handlers are defined as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        <CH.Section>

            <CH.Code>
            ```java MyService.java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/MyService.java
            ```

[//]: # (This code snippet is also used in the communication page, to show how to export the definition)
            </CH.Code>

        - [Use the `@Service` and `@Handler` annotations](focus://1,4)
        - [Handlers have the `Context` parameter](focus://5[22:32]) ([JavaDocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.restate/sdk-api/latest/dev/restate/sdk/Context.html)) as the first parameter.
        Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
        The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
        - The input parameter and return type are optional and can be of any type, as long as they are serializable/deserializable using [Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) ([see serialization docs](/develop/java/serialization)).
        - The service will be reachable under the simple class name `MyService`. You can override it by using the annotation field `name`.
        - [Create an endpoint](focus://10) and [bind the service(s)](focus://11) to the Restate endpoint. [Listen](focus://12) on the specified port (default `9080`) for connections and requests.

        </CH.Section>

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CH.Section>
        <CH.Code>
            ```kotlin MyService.kt
            CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/MyService.kt
            ```
        </CH.Code>

        - [Use the `@Service` and `@Handler` annotations](focus://1,4)
        - [Handlers have the `Context` parameter](focus://5[27:38]) ([JavaDocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.restate/sdk-api/latest/dev/restate/sdk/Context.html)) as the first parameter.
        Within the handler, you use the `Context` to interact with Restate.
        The SDK stores the actions you do on the context in the Restate journal to make them durable.
        - The input parameter and return type are optional and can be of any type, as long as they are serializable/deserializable using [Kotlin serialization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html) ([see serialization docs](/develop/java/serialization)).
        - The service will be reachable under the simple class name `MyService`. You can override it by using the annotation field `name`.
        - [Create an endpoint](focus://11,12) and [bind the service(s)](focus://13) to the Restate endpoint. [Listen](focus://14) on the specified port (default `9080`) for connections and requests.

        </CH.Section>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Virtual Objects
[Virtual Objects](/concepts/services#virtual-objects) and their handlers are defined similarly to services, with the following differences:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CH.Section>
            <CH.Code>
                ```java
                CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/MyVirtualObject.java
                ```
            </CH.Code>

        - [Use the `@VirtualObject` annotation.](focus://1)
        - [The first argument of the handler must be the `ObjectContext` parameter](focus://5[29:45]) ([JavaDocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.restate/sdk-api/latest/dev/restate/sdk/ObjectContext.html)).
        Handlers with the `ObjectContext` parameter can write to the K/V state store.
        Only one handler can be active at a time, to ensure consistency.
        - [If you want to have a handler that executes concurrently to the others and doesn't have write access to the K/V state, use the `@Shared` annotation and the `SharedObjectContext`.](focus://9,10[39:61])
        For example, you can use these handlers to read K/V state, or interact with the blocking handler.

        </CH.Section>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CH.Section>
            <CH.Code>
                ```kotlin
                CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/MyVirtualObject.kt
                ```
            </CH.Code>

        - [Use the `@VirtualObject` annotation.](focus://1)
        - [The first argument of the handler must be the `ObjectContext` parameter](focus://5[27:44]) ([JavaDocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.restate/sdk-api/latest/dev/restate/sdk/ObjectContext.html)).
            Handlers with the `ObjectContext` parameter can write to the K/V state store.
            Only one handler can be active at a time, to ensure consistency.
        - [If you want to have a handler that executes concurrently to the others and doesn't have write access to the K/V state, use the `@Shared` annotation and the `SharedObjectContext`.](focus://10,11[37:60])
            For example, you can use these handlers to read K/V state, or interact with the blocking handler.
        </CH.Section>

## Workflows

[Workflows](/concepts/services#workflows) are a special type of Virtual Objects, their definition is similar but with the following differences:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CH.Section>
        <CH.Code>
            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/MyWorkflow.java
            ```
        </CH.Code>

        - [Create the workflow](focus://1,2)
        - [Every workflow implementation needs to have a handler called `run` that implements the workflow logic. This handler uses the `WorkflowContext` to interact with the SDK. The `run` handler executes exactly one time per workflow execution/object.](focus://4:10)
        - [The other handlers of the workflow are used to interact with the workflow: either query it, or signal it. They use the `SharedWorkflowContext` to interact with the SDK. These handlers can run concurrently with the `run` handler and can still be called after the `run` handler has finished.](focus://12:15)
        - Have a look at the workflow docs to learn more.

    </CH.Section>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CH.Section>
        <CH.Code>
            ```kotlin
            CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/MyWorkflow.kt
            ```
        </CH.Code>

</Tabs>

Now that you have a high-level idea of what a Restate service might look like, let's have a look at what the Restate Context allows you to do.


<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
    The Java SDK generates code for service clients when you compile your project.
    Turn on [IntelliJ IDEA annotation processing support](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotation-processors-support.html), to be able to re-run code generation by pressing `CTRL + F9`.
</Admonition>




<details className="grey-details">
    <summary>Annotating interfaces</summary>

    Annotations can also be placed on interfaces. This is useful, for example, if you want to split your service in two packages, one containing the interface and the generated clients, and one containing the implementation.
</details>

<details className="grey-details">
    <summary>Manual project setup</summary>

    You can use the build tool of your choice with the Java/Kotlin SDK. The following instructions use Gradle (Kotlin script).

    <Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
        <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

            To set up your Java project, run:

            ```shell
            gradle init --type java-application
            ```

            Add the following dependencies:

            ```kotlin
            annotationProcessor("dev.restate:sdk-api-gen:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
            implementation("dev.restate:sdk-api:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
            ```

            When serializing composite types/POJOs with [Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) (default), add the following dependency:

            ```kotlin
            implementation("dev.restate:sdk-serde-jackson:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
            ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

            To set up your Kotlin project, run:

            ```shell
            gradle init --type kotlin-application
            ```

            Add the [Kotlin symbol processing](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#use-your-own-processor-in-a-project) and the [Kotlin serialization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html) plugin:

            ```kotlin
            plugins {
                kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "1.9.22"
                id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.9.22-1.0.18"
            }
            ```

            Add the runtime dependency `sdk-api-kotlin` and the `ksp` dependency `sdk-api-kotlin-gen`:

            ```kotlin
            ksp("dev.restate:sdk-api-kotlin-gen:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
            implementation("dev.restate:sdk-api-kotlin:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
            ```

        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Depending on the deployment target, add one of the following dependencies:

    - To run as HTTP endpoint: `dev.restate:sdk-http-vertx:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION`
    - To run on AWS Lambda: `dev.restate:sdk-lambda:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION`
</details>

<details className="grey-details">
    <summary>Manual service definition without annotation processing</summary>
    In case you don't want to use annotation processing, you can manually define your service by using the class `dev.restate.sdk.common.syscalls.ServiceDefinition`. Check the respective JavaDocs/KTDocs for more details.
