# Serving
Restate services can run in two ways: as an HTTP endpoint or as AWS Lambda functions.

## Creating an HTTP endpoint

To create the HTTP endpoint for your services, do the following:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServingHttp.java
```

First, create a `RestateHttpEndpointBuilder`, then bind one or multiple services to the server.

Finally, call `buildAndListen(port)` to have the RestateServer listen on the specified port for connections and requests.

## Creating a Lambda handler

To register your service as a Lambda function,
only minimal changes are required, as compared to the long-running service:

Add the following dependency to your project, for example, using Gradle:

```kotlin
implementation("dev.restate:sdk-lambda:VAR::JAVA_SDK_VERSION")
```

Register your Lambda services as follows:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/ServingLambda.java
```

Create a class that extends `BaseRestateLambdaHandler` with your services binded to it.

Have a look at the [deployment](/deploy/lambda/lambda-java) section
for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.

<Admonition type="info">
That's all you need to do to enable running on AWS Lambda.
The implementation of your service methods remains the same for both deployment options.
