# Clients
The Restate SDK client library lets you invoke Restate handlers from anywhere in your application.
Use this only in non-Restate services without access to the Restate Context.

<Admonition type="note" title={"Use the Restate Context"}>
    Always [invoke handlers via the context](/develop/java/service-communication), if you have access to it.
    Restate then attaches information about the invocation to the parent invocation.
</Admonition>

## Invoking handlers with the SDK clients

Invoke a handler programmatically with the SDK clients as follows:

<Step stepLabel="1" title="Add the dependency to your project">
    ```kotlin
    implementation("dev.restate:sdk-common:VAR::TYPESCRIPT_SDK_VERSION")
    ```
</Step>
<Step stepLabel="2" title={<span><a href={"/operate/registration"}>Register the service</a> you want to invoke.</span>}/>
<Step stepLabel="3" title="Connect to Restate and invoke the handler with your preferred semantics">
    <CH.Spotlight start={1} className="durable-promises">

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_rpc_java>-<end_rpc_java>
        ```

        ---

        **Request-response invocations** allow you to wait on a response from the handler.

        ---

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_one_way_call_java>-<end_one_way_call_java>
        ```

        **One-way invocations** allow you to send a message without waiting for a response.

        ---

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_delayed_call_java>-<end_delayed_call_java>
        ```

        **Delayed invocations** allow you to schedule an invocation for a later point in time.

    </CH.Spotlight>
</Step>

## Invoke a handler idempotently

To make a service call idempotent, you can use the idempotency key feature.
Add the idempotency key [to the header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/) via:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_service_idempotent>-<end_service_idempotent>
```

After the invocation completes, Restate persists the response for a retention period of one day (24 hours).
If you re-invoke the service with the same idempotency key within 24 hours, Restate sends back the same response and doesn't re-execute the request to the service.

<Admonition type="tip" title={"Make any service call idempotent by using Restate"}>
    By using Restate and an idempotency key, you can make any service call idempotent, without any extra code or setup.
    This is a very powerful feature to ensure that your system stays consistent and doesn't perform the same operation multiple times.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title={"Adding headers to the request"}>
    The call options, with which we set the idempotency key, also let you add other headers to the request.
</Admonition>

    <summary> Tuning retention time</summary>

    <CH.Section>
        You can tune the [retention time](focus://3) on a service-level by using the [Admin API](focus://1[15:28]) ([docs](/references/admin-api#tag/service/operation/modify_service)):
        ```shell
        curl -X PATCH localhost:9070/services/MyService \
            -H 'content-type: application/json' \
            -d '{"idempotency_retention": "2days"}'
        ```
        The [retention time](focus://3) is in [humantime format](https://docs.rs/humantime/latest/humantime/).
    </CH.Section>

## Retrieve result of invocations and workflows

You can use the client library to retrieve the results of invocations **with an idempotency key** or workflows.
You can:
- Attach to an ongoing invocation and retrieve the result when it finishes.
- Peek at the output of a running invocation or workflow, to check if it has finished and optionally retrieve the result.

You can use the invocation ID to attach or peek at a service/object invocation that used an idempotency key:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_service_attach>-<end_service_attach>
```
