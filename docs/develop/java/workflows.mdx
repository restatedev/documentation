# Workflows

[Workflows](/concepts/services#workflows) are a sequence of steps that gets executed durably.
A workflow can be seen as a special type of [Virtual Object](/concepts/services#virtual-objects) with some special characteristics:

- Each [workflow definition](/develop/java/overview#workflows) has a `run` handler that implements the workflow logic.
- The `run` handler executes exactly one time for each workflow instance (object / key).
- A [workflow definition](/develop/java/overview#workflows) can implement other handlers that can be called multiple times, and can interact with the workflow.
- Workflows have access to the `WorkflowContext` and `SharedWorkflowContext`, giving them some extra functionality, for example [Durable Promises](/develop/java/workflows#signaling-workflows) to signal workflows.

<Admonition type="note" title={"Workflow retention time"}>
    The retention time of a workflow execution is 24 hours after the finishing of the `run` handler.
    After this timeout any [K/V state](/develop/java/state) is cleared, the workflow's shared handlers cannot be called anymore, and the [Durable Promises](/develop/java/workflows#signaling-workflows) are discarded.
    The retention time can be configured via the [Admin API](/references/admin-api/#tag/service/operation/modify_service) per Workflow definition by setting `workflow_completion_retention`.

## Implementing workflows
Have a look at the code example to get a better understanding of how workflows are implemented:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <Scrollycoding>

    ### !!steps The run handler

    Every workflow needs a `run` handler.
    This handler has access to the same SDK features as Service and Virtual Object handlers.
    For example, use [`ctx.run`](/develop/java/journaling-results#journaled-actions) to log intermediate results in Restate and avoid re-execution on replay.

    ```java !
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/workflows/SignupWorkflow.java?1
    ```

    ### !!steps Querying workflows

    Similar to Virtual Objects, you can retrieve the [K/V state](/develop/java/state#retrieving-state) of workflows via the other handlers defined in the workflow definition,
    For example, here we expose the status of the workflow to external clients.
    Every workflow execution can be seen as a new object, so the state is isolated to a single workflow execution.
    The state can only be mutated by the `run` handler of the workflow. The other handlers can only read the state.

    ```java !
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/workflows/SignupWorkflow.java?2
    ```

    ### !!steps Signaling workflows

    You can use Durable Promises to interact with your running workflows: to let the workflow block until an event occurs, or to send a signal / information into or out of a running workflow.
    These promises are durable and distributed, meaning they survive crashes and can be resolved or rejected by any handler in the workflow.

    Do the following:
    1. Create a promise that is durable and distributed in the `run` handler.
    2. Resolve or reject the promise in another handler in the workflow. This can be done at most one time.

    You can also use this pattern in reverse and let the `run` handler resolve promises that other handlers are waiting on.
    For example, the `run` handler could resolve a promise when it finishes a step of the workflow, so that other handlers can request whether this step has been completed.


    ```java !
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/workflows/SignupWorkflow.java?3
    ```

    ### !!steps Serving and registering workflows

    You serve workflows in the same way as Services and Virtual Objects: by binding them to an [HTTP endpoint](/develop/java/serving#creating-an-http-endpoint) or [AWS Lambda handler](/develop/java/serving#creating-a-lambda-handler).
    Make sure you [register the endpoint or Lambda handler](/operate/registration) in Restate before invoking it.

    ```java !
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/workflows/SignupWorkflow.java?4
    ```

## Inspecting workflows

Have a look at the [introspection docs](/operate/introspection) on how to inspect workflows.
You can use this to for example:
- [Inspect the progress of a workflow by looking at the invocation journal](/operate/introspection#inspecting-the-invocation-journal)
- [Inspect the K/V state of a workflow](/operate/introspection#inspecting-application-state)
