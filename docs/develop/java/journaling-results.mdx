# Journaling Results

Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
This means that non-deterministic results (e.g. database responses, UUID generation) need to be stored in the execution log.
The SDK offers some functionalities to help you with this:
1. **[Journaled actions](/develop/java/journaling-results#journaled-actions)**: Run any block of code and store the result in Restate. Restate replays the result instead of re-executing the block on retries.
2. **[`Awaitable` combinators](/develop/java/journaling-results#awaitable-combinators)**: Log the order in which Awaitables were resolved/rejected, to ensure deterministic replay.
3. **[Random generators](/develop/java/journaling-results#generating-randoms)**: Built-in helpers for generating stable UUIDs and random numbers.


## Journaled actions
You can store the result of a (non-deterministic) operation in the Restate execution log (e.g. database requests, HTTP calls, etc).
Restate replays the result instead of re-executing the operation on retries.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string response is stored in Restate:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/JournalingResults.java#side_effect
```

You can use Restate's built-in `CoreSerdes` to serialize primitive types.
Have a look at the [serialization docs](/develop/java/serialization) for other options.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/JournalingResults.kt#side_effect
```

By default, Kotlin serialization is used to serialize the result.
Have a look at the [serialization docs](/develop/java/serialization), for other options.

</Tabs>

You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a `ctx.run` function.
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting other journaled actions.

<Admonition type="note" title="Failure semantics">
Failures in `ctx.run` have the same semantics as failures in the rest of your handler code.
By default, the `ctx.run` function is retried infinitely on failure, unless you throw a [terminal error](/develop/java/error-handling).
</Admonition>

## Awaitable combinators
Operations such as calls, awakeables, and sleep return a `Awaitable`.
The SDK provides combinators for working with `Awaitable`.
Restate then logs the order in which they are resolved or rejected, to make them deterministic on replay.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>
        **Await all** creates an `Awaitable` that awaits for all of the provided Awaitables to resolve.
        The semantics are similar to [`CompleteableFuture.allOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#allOf(java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture...)), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/JournalingResults.java#combine_all
        ```
    </CH.Scrollycoding>
    <CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>
        **Await any** creates an `Awaitable` that awaits any of the provided Awaitables to resolve.
        The semantics are similar to [`CompleteableFuture.anyOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#anyOf(java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture...)), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/JournalingResults.java#combine_any

        ### Await all

        Creates an `Awaitable` that awaits for all of the provided Awaitables to resolve.
        The semantics are similar to [`CompleteableFuture.allOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#allOf(java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture...)), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

    <CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>
        ### Await any

        Creates an `Awaitable` that awaits any of the provided Awaitables to resolve.

        The semantics are similar to [`CompleteableFuture.anyOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#anyOf(java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture...)), but the outcome is stored in the Restate journal to be deterministically replayable.

## Generating randoms
The SDK provides helper functions for the deterministic generation of UUIDs and random numbers.
Restate seeds the random number generator with the invocation ID, so it always returns the same value on retries.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>
        ### Generating UUIDs

        You can use these UUIDs to generate stable idempotency keys, to deduplicate operations. For example, you can use this to let a payment service avoid duplicate payments during retries.

        Do not use this in cryptographic contexts.

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/JournalingResults.java#uuid
        ```

    </CH.Scrollycoding>
    <CH.Scrollycoding className={clsx("single-item", "durable-promises-short")}>

        ### Generating random numbers

        This returns a new pseudorandom float within the range `[0,1]`.
        This is the equivalent of JS `Math.random()` but deterministically replayable.

        You can use any of the methods of [`java.util.Random`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) to generate random numbers: for example, `nextBoolean()`, `nextLong()`, `nextFloat()`, etc.

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/JournalingResults.java#random_nb
        ```
