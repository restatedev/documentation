# State
You can store key-value state in Restate.
Restate makes sure the state is consistent with the processing of the code execution.

**This feature is only available for Virtual Objects and Workflows:**
- For **Virtual Objects**, the state is isolated per Virtual Object and lives forever (across invocations for that object).
- For **Workflows**, you can think of it as if every workflow execution is a new object. So the state is isolated to a single workflow execution.
The state can only be mutated by the `run` handler of the workflow. The other handlers can only read the state.

<Admonition type="info" title="Command-line introspection">
You can inspect and edit the K/V state stored in Restate via `psql` and the CLI.
Have a look at the [introspection docs](/operate/introspection#inspecting-application-state) for more information.

You can do the following operations on the state:

### Listing state keys
For a single Virtual Object, you can list all the state keys that have entries in the state store via:
<CodeWithTabs groupId="sdk">
    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/State.java#statekeys
    ```
    ```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/State.kt#statekeys
    ```
</CodeWithTabs>

## Retrieving state
<CodeWithTabs groupId="sdk">
    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/State.java#get
    ```
    ```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/State.kt#get
    ```
</CodeWithTabs>

1. Define the state key (key name and [type](/develop/java/serialization)) at the top of the Virtual Object class.
2. Use `ctx.get` to retrieve the state for a specific key.

## Setting state
<CodeWithTabs groupId="sdk">
    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/State.java#set
    ```
    ```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/State.kt#set
    ```
</CodeWithTabs>

1. Define the state key (key name and [type](/develop/java/serialization)) at the top of the Virtual Object class.
2. Use `ctx.set` to set the state for a specific key. The type of value needs to line up with the type that was defined in the StateKey.

## Clearing state

<CodeWithTabs groupId="sdk">
    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/State.java#clear
    ```
    ```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/State.kt#clear
    ```
</CodeWithTabs>

1. Define the state key (key name and [type](/develop/java/serialization)) at the top of the Virtual Object class.
2. Use `ctx.clear` to delete the state for a specific key.

## Clearing all state
<CodeWithTabs groupId="sdk">
    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/State.java#clear_all
    ```
    ```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/develop/State.kt#clear_all
    ```
</CodeWithTabs>

This will delete all the state stored in Restate for the Virtual Object.
