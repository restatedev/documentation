# Restate context

In Restate services, all interaction with the runtime occurs through the Restate context.
This context provides a set of methods that allow you to perform actions such as getting or setting state, or
calling other services.

You can retrieve the context object as follows:

The Restate context is supplied as the first argument `ctx` to the method.

For unkeyed services:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/RestateContext.java#<start_unkeyed>-<end_unkeyed>
```

For keyed services:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/RestateContext.java#<start_keyed>-<end_keyed>
```

<Admonition type="note">
Have a look at the [Context JavaDocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.restate/sdk-api/latest/dev/restate/sdk/Context.html) and [ObjectContext JavaDocs](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.restate/sdk-api/latest/dev/restate/sdk/ObjectContext.html) for an overview of what you can do with the Restate context.

<summary>Alternative: vanilla gRPC</summary>

If you do not use Restate's generated protobuf code, you can access the restate context as follows.

For unkeyed services:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/RestateContext.java#<start_grpc_unkeyed>-<end_grpc_unkeyed>
```

For keyed services:

```java
CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/develop/RestateContext.java#<start_grpc_keyed>-<end_grpc_keyed>
```

<Admonition type="info">
The code blocks in the documentation refer to the Restate Context via the variable named `ctx`.

<Admonition type="info">
All method calls made through the Restate context are durably stored in the execution log
and can be replayed in case of failure, ensuring that your service is always reliable and fault-tolerant.
This means that if you do actions (e.g. calling other services, sleep) without making use of the Restate SDK,
you do not have these benefits.
