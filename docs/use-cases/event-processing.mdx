## Event processing with Restate

Connect functions to Kafka topics.
Restate pushes the events to your function.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller">

    ### !!steps Lightweight Durable Functions
    Write functions that take Kafka events as inputs.
    Functions execute with Durable Execution: their progress is tracked and they can be retried from the exact point before the crash, as if you are taking micro-checkpoints throughout the function execution.

    ```ts ! user_updates.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/event_processing.ts?1
    ```

    ### !!steps Push events to functions
    Let Restate subscribe to a Kafka topic and specify to which function to push the events.
    Restate will take care of the event plumbing: polling for records, committing offsets, recovering...

    ```shell ! curl
    curl restate:9070/subscriptions --json '{
        "source": "kafka://my-cluster/user-events",
        "sink": "service://userUpdates/updateUserEvent"
    }'
    ```

    ### !!steps Queue per key
    Events get sent to objects based on the Kafka key.
    For each key, Restate ensures that events are processed sequentially and in order.
    Slow events on other keys do not block processing.

    In the example, we process user updates in a queue per user.
    Slow updates for one user do not block updates for other users.

    ```ts ! user_updates.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/event_processing.ts?1
    ```

    ### !!steps Postpone processing

    Flexibly postpone processing of events until later.
    Restate tracks the timers and re-invokes.
    When sleeping, other events for that key are enqueued.

    Here, we postpone processing for 5 seconds if the user profile is not ready yet.

    ```ts ! user_updates.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/event_processing.ts?2
    ```

    ### !!steps Durable side effects

    The results of interactions with external systems are tracked and recovered after failures. This simplifies writing flows that keep multiple systems in sync.

    ```ts ! user_updates.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/event_processing.ts?3
    ```

    ### !!steps Flexible control flow

    As opposed to many stream processing systems, Restate does not put any restrictions on the control flow (e.g. DAG).
    Each event crafts its own path through the code
    and builds up its own recovery log.

    ```ts ! user_updates.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/event_processing.ts?4
    ```

## Stateful event processing with Restate

Implement stateful event handlers with Restate.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
        <Scrollycoding className={"workflows-scroller"}>

    ### !!steps K/V State
    Store state in Restate and access it from other handlers.
    Restate guarantees that it is consistent and persistent.
    The state gets delivered together with the request, so you operate on local state.

    ```ts ! profile_service.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/events_state.ts?1
    ```



    ### !!steps Event Enrichment

    Enrich events with data from multiple sources by storing it in state and eventually exposing it via other functions.

    ```ts ! profile_service.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/events_state.ts?2
    ```



    ### !!steps Delayed actions
    Schedule async follow-up tasks for now or for later.
    Restate tracks the timers and triggers them when the time comes.

    Here, we wait one second for other user features to arrive before sending the event to downstream processing.

    ```ts ! profile_service.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/events_state.ts?3
    ```



    ### !!steps Combine Kafka and RPC

    Functions can be called over RPC or Kafka without changing the code.
    In the example, the registration can come over Kafka, while the email gets called via HTTP.

    ```ts ! profile_service.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing/events_state.ts?2

            ```

            ### !!steps Delayed actions
            Schedule async follow-up tasks for now or for later.
            Restate tracks the timers and triggers them when the time comes.

            Here, we wait one second for other user features to arrive before sending the event to downstream processing.

            ```py ! profile_service.py
            CODE_LOAD::python/src/use_cases/event_processing/events_state.py?3
            ```

            ### !!steps Combine Kafka and RPC

            Functions can be called over RPC or Kafka without changing the code.
            In the example, the registration can come over Kafka, while the email gets called via HTTP.

            ```py ! profile_service.py
            CODE_LOAD::python/src/use_cases/event_processing/events_state.py?2
            ```
