## Event processing with Restate

Connect functions to Kafka topics.
Restate pushes the events to your function.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller">

    ### Queue per key
    Events get send to objects based on the Kafka key. For each key, Restate ensures events are processed sequentially and in order.
    Slow events on other keys do not block processing.


    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Flexible control flow

    As opposed to many stream processing systems, Restate does not put any restrictions on the control flow (e.g. DAG).
    Each event craft its own path through the code
    and builds up its own recovery log.

    <CH.Code>
        ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
        ```
    </CH.Code>

    ---

    ### Delayed actions

    Flexibly postpone processing of events until later
    or schedule follow-up tasks. Restate tracks the timers and re-invokes.
    When sleeping, other events for that key are enqueued.


    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Durable side effects

    The results of interactions with external systems are tracked and recovered after failures. This simplifies writing flows that keep multiple systems in sync.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

Stateful event processing

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"workflows-scroller"}>

    ### K/V State
    Store state in Restate and access it from other handlers. Restate guarantees that it is consistent and persistent.
    ```ts submit.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/events_state.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Combine Kafka and RPC

    Functions can be called over RPC or Kafka without changing the code.
    In the example, the registration can come over Kafka, while the email gets called via HTTP.


    ```ts submit.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/events_state.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Event Enrichment

    Enrich events with data from multiple sources by storing it in state and eventually exposing it via other functions.


    ```ts submit.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/events_state.ts
    ```
