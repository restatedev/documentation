## Async tasks with Restate
Schedule tasks for now or later with the Restate SDK.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller-large">

    ### Execute any handler async

    Every handler in Restate is executed asynchronously and can be treated
    as a reliable asynchronous task. No matter whether it is a simple function, or a complex workflow.
    Restate persists the requests to this handler and makes sure they run to completion.
    Restate handles retries and recovery upon failures.

    <CH.Code>

        ```ts async_task_service.ts focus=1:8 mark=4:6
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/async_task_service.ts
        ```


        ```ts task_submitter.ts
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/task_submitter.ts
        ```

    </CH.Code>

    ---

    ### Schedule tasks reliably

    Schedule tasks asynchronously, by using Restate as message queue.
    Restate reliably queues them, also under backpressure/load.

    Handlers can be called asynchronously from anywhere.
    This returns a task handle once the call in enqueued.

    ```ts task_submitter.ts focus=1:9,13 mark=4:9
    ```

    ---

    ### Idempotent task submission

    Use an idempotency key to ensure that the task is only scheduled once.
    Restate will deduplicate the request and return the previous response.


    ```ts task_submitter.ts focus=1:9,13 mark=8
    ```

    ---

    ### Latch on to the task

    For requests with an idempotency key, you can use this task handle to latch on to the task later and retrieve the result, or wait for it to finish.

    ```ts task_submitter.ts focus=1:13 mark=12
    ```

    ---

    This works across processes, so you can have a separate process latch on to the task later.

    ```ts task_submitter.ts focus=15:18 mark=17
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/task_attach.ts
    ```

## Parallelizing work with Restate

Write flexible scheduling logic via durable building blocks.

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"workflows-scroller"}>

    Restate makes it easy to parallelize async work by fanning out tasks.
    Afterwards, you can collect the result by fanning in the partial results.
    Durable Execution ensures that the fan-out and fan-in steps happen
      reliably exactly once.

    ```ts fan_out_worker.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/fan_out_fan_in.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Fan out

    Fan out tasks by calling the subtask handler for each subtask.
    Every handler is an asynchronous task, for which Restate serves as the queue.

    The subtasks might run in different processes, if this is deployed in a parallel setup.

    ```ts fan_out_worker.ts focus=4:14,18:23 mark=10:12
    ```

    ---

    ### Fan in
    Invocations produce durable promises that can be awaited and combined.
    Fan in by simply awaiting the combined promise.
    Invocation promises recover from failures, re-connect to running subtasks.

    ```ts fan_out_worker.ts focus=5:17,18:23 mark=16:17
    ```

    ---

    ### Server(less)
    Deploy this service on an platform like Kubernetes or AWS Lambda to
    automatically get parallel scale out.

    ```ts fan_out_worker.ts mark=27
    ```

## Switch between async and sync with Restate

<CH.Scrollycoding className={"workflows-scroller"}>
    Imagine a data preparation workflow that creates an S3 bucket, uploads a file to it, and then returns the URL.

    Let's now kick off this workflow from another process.

    <CH.Code>

        ```ts data_preparation_client.ts mark=5:10
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/data_preparation_service.ts
        ```

        ```ts client.ts
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/client.ts
        ```
    </CH.Code>

    ---

    1. Connect to the Restate server and create a client for the data preparation workflow.

    ```ts client.ts focus=1:7,18 mark=7
    ```

    ---

    2. Kick off a new data preparation workflow. This is idempotent per workflow ID.

    ```ts client.ts focus=1:9,18 mark=9
    ```

    ---

    3. Wait for the result for 30 seconds.

    ```ts client.ts focus=1:11,18 mark=11
    ```

    ---

    4. If it takes longer, rewire the workflow to send an email instead.
    If returns within 30 seconds, process the URL directly.

    ```ts client.ts focus=1:20 mark=13:19
    ```

    ---

    5. This is implemented in the data preparation workflow by letting the workflow signal our handler when it's done.
    It does this by resolving a shared Durable Promise that we then retrieve in our handler to send the email.

    ```ts data_preparation_client.ts focus=4:16 mark=8,13:16
    ```
