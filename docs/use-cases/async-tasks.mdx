            ### !!steps Execute any handler async

            Every handler in Restate is executed asynchronously and can be treated
            as a reliable asynchronous task. No matter whether it is a simple function, or a complex workflow.
            Restate persists the requests to this handler and makes sure they run to completion.
            Restate handles retries and recovery upon failures.

            ```ts !!windows async_task_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/async_task_service.ts?1
            ```

            ```ts !!windows task_submitter.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/task_submitter.ts
            ```

            ### !!steps Schedule tasks reliably

            Schedule tasks asynchronously, by using Restate as message queue.
            Restate reliably queues them, also under backpressure/load.

            Handlers can be called asynchronously from anywhere.
            This returns a task handle once the call in enqueued.

            ```ts !!windows async_task_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/async_task_service.ts
            ```

            ```ts !!windows task_submitter.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/task_submitter.ts?1
            ```

            ### !!steps Idempotent task submission

            Use an idempotency key to ensure that the task is only scheduled once.
            Restate will deduplicate the request and return the previous response.

            ```ts !!windows async_task_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/async_task_service.ts
            ```

            ```ts !!windows task_submitter.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/task_submitter.ts?2
            ```

            ### !!steps Latch on to the task

            For requests with an idempotency key, you can use this task handle to latch on to the task later and retrieve the result, or wait for it to finish.

            ```ts !!windows async_task_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/async_task_service.ts
            ```

            ```ts !!windows task_submitter.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/simple_async_task/task_submitter.ts?3
            ```

            ### !!steps
            This works across processes, so you can have a separate process latch on to the task later.

            ```ts !!windows async_task_service.ts

## Parallelizing work with Restate

Write flexible scheduling logic via durable building blocks.

Restate makes it easy to parallelize async work by fanning out tasks.
Afterwards, you can collect the result by fanning in the partial results.
Durable Execution ensures that the fan-out and fan-in steps happen
reliably exactly once.

        <Scrollycoding className={"workflows-scroller"}>

            ### !!steps Fan out

            Fan out tasks by calling the subtask handler for each subtask.
            Every handler is an asynchronous task, for which Restate serves as the queue.

            The subtasks might run in different processes, if this is deployed in a parallel setup.

            ### !!steps Fan in
            Invocations produce durable promises that can be awaited and combined.
            Fan in by simply awaiting the combined promise.
            Invocation promises recover from failures, re-connect to running subtasks.

## Switch between async and sync with Restate
Imagine a data preparation workflow that creates an S3 bucket, uploads a file to it, and then returns the URL.

Let's now kick off this workflow from another process.

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
        <Scrollycoding className={"workflows-scroller-large"}>
            ### !!steps

            1. Connect to the Restate server and create a client for the data preparation workflow.

            ```ts !!windows client.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/client.ts?1
            ```

            ```ts !!windows data_preparation_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/data_preparation_service.ts
            ```

            ### !!steps

            2. Kick off a new data preparation workflow. This is idempotent per workflow ID.

            ```ts !!windows client.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/client.ts?2
            ```

            ```ts !!windows data_preparation_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/data_preparation_service.ts
            ```

            ### !!steps

            3. Wait for the result for 30 seconds.

            ```ts !!windows client.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/client.ts?3
            ```

            ```ts !!windows data_preparation_service.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/data_preparation_service.ts
            ```

            ### !!steps

            4. If it takes longer, rewire the workflow to send an email instead.
            If returns within 30 seconds, process the URL directly.

            ```ts !!windows client.ts
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/async_tasks/sync_to_async/client.ts?4

            1. Connect to the Restate server and create a client for the data preparation workflow.

            ```java ! MyClient.java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/usecases/asynctasks/synctoasync/MyClient.java?1
            ```

            ### !!steps

            2. Kick off a new data preparation workflow. This is idempotent per workflow ID.

            ```java ! MyClient.java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/usecases/asynctasks/synctoasync/MyClient.java?2
            ```

            3. Wait for the result for 30 seconds.

            ```java ! MyClient.java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/usecases/asynctasks/synctoasync/MyClient.java?3
            ```

            ### !!steps

            4. If it takes longer, rewire the workflow to send an email instead.
            If returns within 30 seconds, process the URL directly.
