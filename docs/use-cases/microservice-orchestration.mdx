## Resilient Code Execution

<Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller">

    ### !!steps Familiar programming constructs, but now resilient
    Restate turns the programming building blocks you already know, into resilient constructs.
    Work with objects, functions, and promises as if failures donâ€™t happen.
    Restate can recover them anytime, anywhere.

    ```


    ### !!steps Persist progress

    Do calls to multiple systems and persist the results.
    On retries, the action does not get re-executed but the previous result will be recovered.
    Interact with multiple systems in a row and Restate makes sure that all interactions take place.

## Durable Communication, Scheduling & Idempotency

Restate sits like a reverse-proxy or message broker in front of your services.
It persists and deduplicates all communication to and between your services.

<Scrollycoding>

    ### !!steps Resilient RPC and messaging

    Restate proxies RPC calls and ensures they are delivered and processed:
    - request-response
    - message (one-way)
    - scheduled tasks

    ```

    ### !!steps Idempotency for free

    Add an idempotency token to your request to let Restate deduplicate them for you.
    Each request runs to completion exactly once.

## Sagas and Distributed Transactions
Restate guarantees code runs to completion. This lets you implement resilient [sagas](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/saga-pattern-microservices) in a try-catch block.
Restate takes care of retries and recovery.

<Scrollycoding>
    ### !!steps Track compensations

    If code execution is durable, then sagas can be expressed purely in code.

    As the function executes, we track the undo operations in a list.

    ```ts !!tabs TypeScript
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/microservices/subscription_saga.ts?1
    ```

    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/usecases/microservices/SubscriptionSaga.java?1

    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/usecases/microservices/saga/SubscriptionSaga.kt?1
    ```

    ```go !!tabs Go
    CODE_LOAD::go/usecases/microservices/saga/subscriptionsaga.go?1
    ```

    ```py !!tabs Python
    CODE_LOAD::python/src/use_cases/microservices/subscription_saga.py?1
    ```

    ### !!steps Guaranteed roll back

    When an error occurs for which we do not want to retry or continue, we roll back the changes we already did.

    Restate makes sure all compensations run.

## Stateful Entities and State Machines
Restate lets you implement stateful services by storing state in Restate.

<Scrollycoding>
    ### !!steps Consistent state

    Implement state machines, where state transitions are always consistent with the code.


    ```ts !!tabs TypeScript
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/microservices/subscription_object.ts?1
    ```

    ```java !!tabs Java
    CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/usecases/microservices/SubscriptionObject.java?1
    ```

    ```kotlin !!tabs Kotlin
    CODE_LOAD::kotlin/src/main/kotlin/usecases/microservices/vo/SubscriptionObject.kt?1
    ```

    ```go !!tabs Go
    CODE_LOAD::go/usecases/microservices/vo/subscriptionobject.go?1
    ```

    ```py !!tabs Python
    CODE_LOAD::python/src/use_cases/microservices/subscription_object.py?1
    ```

    ### !!steps Scalability, concurrency, consistency

    Restate guards consistency by making sure at most one handler is writing to a single state value.

    Scale out without fearing issues such as multiple writers to state, lost updates, race conditions, inconsistencies, etc.

    ```

    ```py !!tabs Python
    CODE_LOAD::python/src/use_cases/microservices/subscription_object.py?2
    ```

    ### !!steps Stateful serverless

    You can run stateful services on serverless infrastructure.
    Restate attaches the state to the request.
    Your handlers work on local state.
