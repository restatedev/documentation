## Microservice Orchestration with Restate

Turn functions into durable handlers with the Restate SDK.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller">

    ### Distributed, durable building blocks
    Work with objects, functions, and promises as if failures don’t happen.
    Restate makes them distributed and durable out-of-the-box.


    ```ts role_updater.ts mark=1,4
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/role_updater.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Scalability, concurrency, consistency

    Restate sequences requests per key, if desired.
    Scale out without fearing issues such as race conditions, multiple writers to state, etc.

    This handler updates a user’s role in set of systems.
    Other updates to the same user are queued and processed in order.
    Updates either succeed or fail, but never leave the user in an inconsistent state.

    ```ts role_updater.ts mark=4
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/role_updater.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Persist progress

    Store results of interaction with external systems or non-deterministic actions.
    On retries, the action does not get re-executed but the previous result will be returned.

    ```ts role_updater.ts mark=7,8,13:14
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/role_updater.ts
    ```

    ---


    ### Sagas and rollbacks

    Implement compensation logic with Restate’s durable building blocks and Restate takes care of running it till completion.

    Here, we update the user’s role in multiple systems. If one fails, we rollback the changes in the other systems.

    ```ts role_updater.ts mark=12:16,18
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/role_updater.ts
    ```

</CH.Scrollycoding>


<p className={"padding-top--lg"}>Proxy RPC calls to other services via Restate and get durability and idempotency for free.</p>

<CH.Scrollycoding>

    ### Durable RPC
    Send requests to other services and Restate ensures they are delivered and processed.
    Requests can be done as request-response, as message, or delayed action.

    ```ts product_reservation.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/idempotency.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Idempotency for free

    Add an idempotency token to your request and let Restate take care of deduplication for you.
    Duplicate requests latch on to the previous one and see the same response.

    Here, we reserve a product for a user. We connect to Restate and send a `reserve` request with an idempotency key so retries wouldn't lead to double reservations.

    ```ts product_reservation.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/idempotency.ts
    ```
