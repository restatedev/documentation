## Microservice Orchestration with Restate

Turn functions into durable functions with the Restate SDK.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller">

    ### Distributed, durable building blocks
    Work with objects, functions, and promises as if failures don’t happen.
    Restate makes them distributed and durable out-of-the-box.


    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Scalability and concurrency

    Restate sequences requests per key, if desired. Scale out without fearing issues such as race conditions, multiple writers to state, etc.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Idempotency for free

    Add an idempotency token to your request and let Restate take care of deduplication for you.
    Duplicate requests latch on to the previous one and see the same response.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Persist progress

    Store results of interaction with external systems or non-deterministic actions.
    On retries, the previous result is returned.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Sagas and rollbacks

    Implement compensation logic with Restate’s durable building blocks and Restate takes care of running it till completion.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/event_processing.ts
    ```
