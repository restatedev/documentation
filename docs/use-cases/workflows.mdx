## Workflows with Restate

Implement the `run` function of your workflow, using the Restate SDK.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="workflows-scroller">

    ### Run once, idempotently
    A workflow runs exactly one time.
    Restate makes sure that duplicate requests do not lead to duplicate execution.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=1:4
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Persist progress

    Store results of intermediate steps, interaction with external systems, or non-deterministic actions.
    Restate makes sure that on retries, the code does not get re-executed and the previous result is returned.
    This lets you execute the steps of your workflows durably.

    <CH.Code>
        ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=8,11,12
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
        ```
    </CH.Code>

    ---

    ### Workflow state

    Use Restate’s built-in key-value store to store workflow state.
    Restate guarantees that it is consistent and persistent, since state updates are tracked together with the rest of the execution progress.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=7,10,16,19
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Query workflow state

    Retrieve the current state of the workflow from within other handlers and expose it to external clients.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=23
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Wait on external signals

    Make Promises/Futures resilient by registering them in Restate.
    Share them and wait until other functions resolve them.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=14
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Signal in-flight workflows

    Notify the workflow of external signals, callbacks or Kafka events.
    Resolve or reject shared promises on which the workflow is waiting.  The workflow handles the outcome.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=25:31
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Flexible failure handling

    Implement sagas and compensations in code, as per your requirements.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts mark=15:20
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/signup_workflow.ts
    ```

    ### Latch on to a workflow
    A workflow runs exactly one time.
    If the caller loses the connection to the workflow, he can latch on again to retrieve the result.

    ```ts submit.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/submit.ts
    ```
