## Workflows with Restate

Implement the `run` function of your workflow, using the Restate SDK.


<CH.Scrollycoding className="durable-promises">

    ### Run once, retrieve later

    A workflow runs exactly one time.
    If the caller loses the connection to the workflow, he can latch on again to retrieve the result.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Workflow state

    Use Restate’s built-in key-value store to store workflow state,
    and expose it to external clients.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Persist progress

    Store results of interaction with external systems or non-deterministic actions. On retries, the previous result is returned.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts focus=11:14
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Wait on external signals

    Make Promises/Futures resilient by registering them in Restate.
    Share them and wait until other functions resolve them.


    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts focus=15:21
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Flexible failure handling

    Implement sagas and compensations in code, as per your requirements.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```

Interact with in-flight workflows

<CH.Scrollycoding>

    ### Query workflow state

    Retrieve the current state of the workflow from within other handlers and expose it to external clients.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```

    ---

    ### Signal in-flight workflows

    Notify the workflow of external signals, callbacks or Kafka events.
    Resolve or reject shared promises on which the workflow is waiting.  The workflow handles the outcome.

    ```ts user_sign_up_flow.ts
    CODE_LOAD::ts/src/use_cases/workflows.ts
    ```
