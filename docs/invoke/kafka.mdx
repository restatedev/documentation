# Kafka

You can invoke handlers via Kafka events, by doing the following:

<Admonition type="info">
    Make sure to first [register the handler](/operate/registration) you want to invoke.
</Admonition>

<SubtleStep stepLabel="1" title="Develop an event handler">

    You can invoke any handler via Kafka events.
    The event payload will be (de)serialized as JSON.

    - When invoking **Virtual Object** handlers via Kafka, the key of the Kafka record will be used to determine the Virtual Object key.
    The key needs to be a valid UTF-8 string.
    For each Virtual Object, the events are delivered in the order in which they arrived on the topic partition.
    - When invoking **Service** handlers over Kafka, events are delivered in parallel without ordering guarantees.

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Combining RPC and Kafka within a service/handler">
        Since you can invoke any handler via Kafka events, a single handler can be invoked both by RPC and via Kafka.
    </Admonition>

</SubtleStep>

<SubtleStep stepLabel="2" title="Configure Restate to connect to a Kafka cluster">
    Define the Kafka cluster that Restate needs to connect to in the [Restate configuration file](/operate/configuration/server#configuration-file):

    ```toml restate.toml
    [[ingress.kafka-clusters]]
    name = "my-cluster"
    brokers = ["PLAINTEXT://broker:9092"]
    ```

    And make sure the Restate Server uses it via _`restate-server --config-file restate.toml`_.

    Check the [configuration docs](/operate/configuration/server) for more details.
</SubtleStep>
<SubtleStep stepLabel="3" title={<span><a href={"/operate/registration"}>Register the service</a> you want to invoke.</span>}/>

<SubtleStep stepLabel="4" title="Subscribe the event handler to the Kafka topic">
    Let Restate forward events from the Kafka topic to the event handler by creating a subscription using the [Admin API](/references/admin-api):

    ```bash
    curl localhost:9070/subscriptions -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        -d '{
            "source": "kafka://my-cluster/my-topic",
            "sink": "service://MyService/handle",
            "options": {"auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}
        }'
    ```

    Once you've created a subscription, Restate immediately starts consuming events from Kafka.
    The handler will be invoked for each event received from Kafka.

    The `options` field is optional and accepts any configuration parameter from [librdkafka configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md).

<Admonition type="info" title="Managing subscriptions">
    Have a look at the [invocation docs](/operate/invocation#managing-kafka-subscriptions) for more commands to manage subscriptions.

    Each event carries within the _`CODE_LOAD::ts/src/develop/kafka.ts#<start_headers>-<end_headers>`_ map the following entries:

    * `restate.subscription.id`: The subscription identifier, as shown by the [Admin API](../../references/admin-api).
    * `kafka.offset`: The record offset.
    * `kafka.partition`: The record partition.
    * `kafka.timestamp`: The record timestamp.

<details className="grey-details">
    <summary>Raw event support</summary>

    If you use annotations for your services and handlers, the event payload will be (de)serialized as JSON.
    If you need to access the raw Kafka payload, you can do this by doing manual service definition.
