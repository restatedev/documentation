# Clients
When you implement a Restate handler, you have access to a Restate `Context`.
You can use this context to invoke other handlers.
Have a look at the Development docs ([TS](/develop/ts/service-communication)/[Java](/develop/java/service-communication)/[Kotlin](/develop/java/service-communication?sdk=kotlin)).


In plain TypeScript/Java/Kotlin code, where you do not have access to the Restate Context, you can invoke handlers programmatically using the Restate SDK client library.

<Admonition type="note" title={"Use the Restate Context"}>
Always invoke handlers via the context, if you have access to it.
Restate then attaches information about the invocation to the parent invocation.
</Admonition>

## Invoking handlers with the SDK clients

Invoke a handler programmatically with the SDK clients as follows:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
        <Step stepLabel="1" title="Add the dependency to your project">
            ```shell
            npm install @restatedev/restate-sdk-clients
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step stepLabel="2" title={<span><a href={"/operate/registration"}>Register the service</a> you want to invoke.</span>}/>
        <Step stepLabel="3" title="Connect to Restate and invoke the handler with your preferred semantics">
            <CH.Spotlight start={1} className="durable-promises">

                ```typescript

                ```

                ---

                **Request-response invocations** allow you to wait on a response from the handler.

                ---

                ```typescript
                CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_one_way_call_node>-<end_one_way_call_node>
                ```

                **One-way invocations** allow you to send a message without waiting for a response.

                ---

                ```typescript
                CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_delayed_call_node>-<end_delayed_call_node>
                ```

                **Delayed invocations** allow you to schedule an invocation for a later point in time.

<Admonition type={"tip"} title={"Retrieve results of one-way invocations and workflows"}>
    You can retrieve the results of one-way invocations with an idempotency key and workflows, as [described here](#retrieve-result-of-invocations-and-workflows).
</Admonition>

## Invoke a handler idempotently

To make a service call idempotent, you can use the idempotency key feature.
Add the idempotency key [to the header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/) via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_service_idempotent>-<end_service_idempotent>
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_service_idempotent>-<end_service_idempotent>
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>



After the invocation completes, Restate persists the response for a retention period of one day (24 hours).
If you re-invoke the service with the same idempotency key within 24 hours, Restate sends back the same response and doesn't re-execute the request to the service.

<Admonition type="tip" title={"Make any service call idempotent by using Restate"}>
    By using Restate and an idempotency key, you can make any service call idempotent, without any extra code or setup.
    This is a very powerful feature to ensure that your system stays consistent and doesn't perform the same operation multiple times.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title={"Adding headers to the request"}>
    The call options, with which we set the idempotency key, also let you add other headers to the request.

    <summary> Tuning retention time</summary>

    <CH.Section>
        You can tune the [retention time](focus://3) on a service-level by using the [Admin API](focus://1[15:28]) ([docs](/references/admin-api#tag/service/operation/modify_service)):
        ```shell
        curl -X PATCH localhost:9070/services/MyService \
            -H 'content-type: application/json' \
            -d '{"idempotency_retention": "2days"}'
        ```
        The [retention time](focus://3) is in [humantime format](https://docs.rs/humantime/latest/humantime/).

## Retrieve result of invocations and workflows

You can use the client library to retrieve the results of invocations with an idempotency key or workflows.
You can:
- Attach to an ongoing invocation and retrieve the result when it finishes.
- Peek at the output of a running invocation or workflow, to check if it has finished and optionally retrieve the result.

You can attach to an ongoing service/object invocation only if the invocation used an idempotency key.

    **Attach to service/object calls** by using the handle that is returned from the invocation.

    ```typescript

    **Attach to workflows** by using the handle that is returned from the invocation, or by using the workflow ID.
