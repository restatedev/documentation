# Clients

In plain TypeScript/Java/Kotlin code, where you do not have access to the Restate Context, you can invoke handlers programmatically using the Restate SDK client library.

<Admonition type="note" title={"In Restate handlers, invoke via the Restate Context"}>
When you implement a Restate handler, you have access to a Restate `Context`.
You can use this context to invoke other handlers.
Have a look at the Development docs ([TS](/develop/ts/service-communication)/[Java](/develop/java/service-communication)/[Kotlin](/develop/java/service-communication?sdk=kotlin)).

Always use this way of invoking handlers when you have access to the context.
This way, Restate attaches information about the invocation to the parent invocation.
</Admonition>

## Invoking handlers with the SDK clients

Then, invoke the Restate handler programmatically from plain TypeScript/Java/Kotlin code, via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        1. Add the dependency to your project:

        ```shell
        npm install @restatedev/restate-sdk-clients
        ```

        2. Make sure to first [register the handler](/operate/registration) you want to invoke.

        3. In your code, connect to Restate:

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_connect>-<end_connect>
        ```



        4. Invoke the handler with your preferred semantics:

        <CH.Spotlight className="durable-promises">

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_rpc_call_node>-<end_rpc_call_node>
            ```

            ---

            **<mark class="accent">Request-response</mark> invocations** allow you to wait on a response from the handler.

            ---

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_one_way_call_node>-<end_one_way_call_node>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">One-way</mark> invocations** allow you to send a message without waiting for a response.

            ---

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_delayed_call_node>-<end_delayed_call_node>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">Delayed</mark> invocations** allow you to schedule an invocation for a later point in time.

        </CH.Spotlight>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">


        1. Add the dependency to your project:

        ```kotlin
        implementation("dev.restate:sdk-common:VAR::TYPESCRIPT_SDK_VERSION")
        ```

        2. Make sure to first [register the handler](/operate/registration) you want to invoke.

        3. From your code, connect to Restate and invoke the handler with the generated clients and your preferred semantics:

        <CH.Spotlight className="durable-promises">

            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_rpc_java>-<end_rpc_java>
            ```

            ---

            **<mark class="accent">Request-response</mark> invocations** allow you to wait on a response from the handler.

            ---

            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_one_way_call_java>-<end_one_way_call_java>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">One-way</mark> invocations** allow you to send a message without waiting for a response.
            You can schedule an invocation as a one-way invocation and later on latch onto it to retrieve the response.
            Have a look below.

            ---

            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_delayed_call_java>-<end_delayed_call_java>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">Delayed</mark> invocations** allow you to schedule an invocation for a later point in time.

        </CH.Spotlight>

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<Admonition type={"tip"} title={"Latch onto running invocations with idempotency key and workflows"}>
    You can latch onto running invocations with an idempotency key and workflows. This lets you retrieve their result if they finished, or attach to them if they are still ongoing.
    Check [the documentation below for more information](#latching-onto-running-invocations-and-workflows) below.
</Admonition>

## Invoke a handler idempotently

You can send requests to Restate providing an idempotency key, through the [`Idempotency-Key` header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/).
You can add the idempotency key to the header via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_service_idempotent>-<end_service_idempotent>
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_service_idempotent>-<end_service_idempotent>
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>



After the invocation completes, Restate persists the response for a retention period of one day (24 hours).
If you re-invoke the service with the same idempotency key within 24 hours, Restate sends back the same response and doesn't re-execute the request to the service.

<Admonition type="tip" title={"Make any service call idempotent by using Restate"}>
    By using Restate and an idempotency key, you can make any service call idempotent, without any extra code or setup.
    This is a very powerful feature to ensure that your system stays consistent and doesn't perform the same operation multiple times.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title={"Adding headers to the request"}>
    You can use these call options to set headers on the request.

    <summary> Tuning retention time</summary>

    <CH.Section>
        You can tune the [retention time](focus://3) on a service-level by using the [Admin API](focus://1[15:28]) ([docs](/references/admin-api#tag/service/operation/modify_service)):
        ```shell
        curl -X PATCH localhost:9070/services/MyService \
        -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        -d '{"idempotency_retention": "2days"}'
        ```
        The [retention time](focus://3) is in [humantime format](https://docs.rs/humantime/latest/humantime/).
    </CH.Section>

## Latching onto running invocations and workflows

You can also use the client library to attach to running invocations with an idempotency key or workflows.
This lets you retrieve their results or wait for them to finish.

**For services or objects**, you can attach to an ongoing invocation only if it used an idempotency key, via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_service_attach>-<end_service_attach>
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


**For workflows**, you can attach to an ongoing invocation via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_workflow_attach>-<end_workflow_attach>
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_workflow_attach>-<end_workflow_attach>
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**For workflows**, you can also **peek at the output** of a running invocation or workflow via:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_workflow_peek>-<end_workflow_peek>
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_workflow_peek>-<end_workflow_peek>
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output contains a `ready` flag that indicates whether the invocation has finished.
And if it has, the `result` contains the output of the invocation.
