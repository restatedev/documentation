# Clients
The Restate SDK client library lets you invoke Restate handlers from anywhere in your application.
Use this only in non-Restate services without access to the Restate Context.

<Admonition type="note" title={"Use the Restate Context"}>
    Always [invoke handlers via the context](/develop/java/service-communication), if you have access to it.
    Restate then attaches information about the invocation to the parent invocation.
</Admonition>

Have a look at the documentation of the SDKs:
