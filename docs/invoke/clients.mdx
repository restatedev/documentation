# Clients

You can use the clients in the Restate SDK to invoke handlers programmatically.

<Admonition type="info">
Make sure to first [register the handler](/operate/registration) you want to invoke.
</Admonition>

## Invoking handlers with the Restate Context

When you implement a Restate handler, you have access to the Restate `Context` or `ObjectContext` object.
You can use this context to invoke other handlers.

Have a look at the Development docs ([TS](/develop/ts/service-communication)/[Java](/develop/java/service-communication)/[Kotlin](/develop/java/service-communication?sdk=kotlin)).

<Admonition type="info">
    Always use this way of invoking handlers when you have access to the context.
    This way, Restate attaches information about the invocation to the parent invocation.
</Admonition>

## Invoking handlers from the client library

If you do not have access to the context, you can use the client library to invoke handlers programmatically.

To invoke a Restate handler programmatically from _plain TypeScript/Java/Kotlin code_, do:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        1. Add the dependency to your project:

        ```shell
        npm install @restatedev/restate-sdk-clients
        ```

        2. In your code, connect to Restate:

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_connect>-<end_connect>
        ```

        3. Invoke the handler with your preferred semantics:

        <CH.Spotlight className="durable-promises">

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_rpc_call_node>-<end_rpc_call_node>
            ```

            ---

            **<mark class="accent">Request-response</mark> invocations** allow you to wait on a response from the handler.

            ---

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_one_way_call_node>-<end_one_way_call_node>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">One-way</mark> invocations** allow you to send a message without waiting for a response.

            ---

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/operate/invocations/ingress.ts#<start_delayed_call_node>-<end_delayed_call_node>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">Delayed</mark> invocations** allow you to schedule an invocation for a later point in time.

        </CH.Spotlight>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">


        1. Add the dependency to your project:

        ```kotlin
        implementation("dev.restate:sdk-common:VAR::TYPESCRIPT_SDK_VERSION")
        ```

        2. From your code, connect to Restate and invoke the handler with the generated clients and your preferred semantics:

        <CH.Spotlight className="durable-promises">

            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_rpc_java>-<end_rpc_java>
            ```

            ---

            **<mark class="accent">Request-response</mark> invocations** allow you to wait on a response from the handler.

            ---

            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_one_way_call_java>-<end_one_way_call_java>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">One-way</mark> invocations** allow you to send a message without waiting for a response.

            ---

            ```java
            CODE_LOAD::java/src/main/java/operate/invocations/Ingress.java#<start_delayed_call_java>-<end_delayed_call_java>
            ```

            **<mark class="accent">Delayed</mark> invocations** allow you to schedule an invocation for a later point in time.
