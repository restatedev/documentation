# SQL Introspection API

This page contains the reference of the introspection tables.
To learn how to access the instrospection interface, check out the [instrospection documentation](/operate/introspection).

## Table: `state`

| Column name | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `partition_key` | `UInt64` | Internal column that is used for partitioning the services invocations. Can be ignored. |
| `service_name` | `Utf8` | The name of the invoked service. |
| `service_key` | `Utf8` | The key of the Virtual Object. |
| `key` | `Utf8` | The `utf8` state key. |
| `value_utf8` | `Utf8` | Only contains meaningful values when a service stores state as `utf8`. This is the case for services that serialize state using JSON (default for Typescript SDK, Java/Kotlin SDK if using JsonSerdes). |
| `value` | `Binary` | A binary, uninterpreted representation of the value. You can use the more specific column `value_utf8` if the value is a string. |
