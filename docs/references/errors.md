# Error codes

This page contains the list of error codes emitted by Restate components.

## META0001

Bad service definition encountered while registering/updating a service.
When defining a service, make sure:

* The service has at least one method 
* Use a fully qualified service name (`package_name.service_name`) that doesn't start with `dev.restate` or `grpc`
* The service is annotated with the `dev.restate.ext.service_type` extension

Example:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
import "dev/restate/ext.proto";

package com.example;

service HelloWorld {
  option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

  rpc greet (GreetingRequest) returns (GreetingResponse);
}
```

## META0002

Bad key definition encountered while registering/updating a service. 
When a service is keyed, for each method the input message must have a field annotated with `dev.restate.ext.field`. 
When defining the key field, make sure:

* The field type is either a primitive or a custom message, and not a repeated field nor a map.
* The field type is the same for every method input message of the same service.

Example:

```protobuf
service HelloWorld {
  option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

  rpc greet (GreetingRequest) returns (GreetingResponse);
}

message GreetingRequest {
  Person person = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];
}
```

## META0003

Cannot reach the endpoint to execute service discovery. Make sure:

* The provided `uri` is correct
* The service endpoint is up and running
* The Restate runtime can reach the service endpoint through the configured `uri`
* If additional authentication is required, make sure it's configured through `additional_headers`

## META0004

Cannot register the provided service endpoint, because it conflicts with the uri of an already registered service endpoint.

In Restate service endpoints have a unique uri and are immutable, thus it's not possible to discover the same endpoint uri twice. 
Make sure, when updating a service endpoint, to assign it a new uri. 

You can force the override using the `"force": true` field in the discover request, but beware that this can lead in-flight invocations to an unrecoverable error state.  

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/services/upgrades-removal) for more information.

## META0005

Cannot propagate endpoint/service metadata to Restate components. If you see this error when starting Restate, this might indicate a corrupted Meta storage.

We recommend wiping the Meta storage and recreate it by registering endpoints in the same order they were registered before.

## META0006

Cannot register the newly discovered service revision in the provided service endpoint, because it conflicts with an already existing service revision.

When implementing a new service revision, make sure that:

* The service instance type and the key definition, if any, is exactly the same as of the previous revisions.
* The Protobuf contract and message definitions are backward compatible.

See the [versioning documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/services/upgrades-removal) for more information.

## META0007

Bad input message field annotation encountered while registering/updating a service. 

You can have at most one field in a message definition annotated with the same `dev.restate.ext.field` annotation.

## META0008

Bad type for input message field annotated with either `EVENT_PAYLOAD` or `EVENT_METADATA`. 

Fields annotated with `(dev.restate.ext.field) = EVENT_PAYLOAD` can have only `bytes` or `string` types.
Fields annotated with `(dev.restate.ext.field) = EVENT_METADATA` can have only `map<string, string>` type.

## META0009

The provided subscription is invalid. Subscriptions should have:

* A `source` field in the format of `kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>`. When registering, the Kafka cluster should be configured in the Restate configuration.
* A `sink` field in the format of `service://<SERVICE_NAME>/<METHOD_NAME>`. When registering, service and method should have been previously registered as well.
* Additional constraints may apply depending on the sink service contract

Please look at the [Kafka documentation page](https://docs.restate.dev/services/sdk/kafka) for more details on subscriptions and event handlers.

## RT0001

The invocation response stream was aborted due to the timeout configured in `worker.invoker.response_abort_timeout`.
This timeout is fired when Restate has an open invocation, and it's waiting only for response messages, but no message is seen for the configured time.

Suggestions:

* Check for bugs in your code. Most likely no message was sent to Restate because your code is blocked and/or reached a deadlock.
* If your code is supposed to not send any message to Restate for longer than the configured timeout, because for example is doing a blocking operation that takes a long time, change the configuration accordingly.

## RT0002

Cannot start Restate because the configuration cannot be parsed. Check the configuration file and the environment variables provided.

For a complete list of configuration options, and a sample configuration, check https://docs.restate.dev/restate/configuration

## RT0003

The invocation failed because the invoker received a message from a service endpoint larger than the `worker.invoker.message_size_limit`.

Suggestions:

* Check in your code whether there is a case where a very large message can be generated, such as a state entry being too large, a request payload being too large, etc.
* Increase the limit by tuning the `worker.invoker.message_size_limit` config entry, eventually tuning the memory of your operating system/machine where Restate is running.

## RT0004

Failed starting process because it could not bind to configured address.
This happens usually if another process has already bound to this address.

Suggestions:

* Select an address that is free.
* Stop the process that has bound to the specified address.
* Make sure you have the permissions to bind to the configured port. Some operating systems require admin/root privileges to bind to ports lower than 1024.

## RT0005

Failed opening RocksDB, because the db file is currently locked.  
This happens usually if another process still holds the lock.

Suggestions:

* Check no other Restate process is running and using the same db file.
* Configure a different RocksDB storage directory via `worker.storage_rocksdb.path`.

## RT0006

An error occurred while invoking the service endpoint. 
This is a generic error which can be caused by many reasons, including:

* Transient network or storage errors
* Misconfiguration of the service endpoint and/or of the Restate runtime
* Non-deterministic user code execution
* Restate runtime and/or SDK bug

We suggest checking the service endpoint logs as well to get any hint on the error cause.

## RT0007

A retry-able error was received from the service endpoint while processing the invocation.

Suggestions:

* Check the service endpoint logs to get more info about the error cause, like the stacktrace.
* Look at the https://docs.restate.dev/services/sdk/error-handling for more info about error handling in services.
