# Restate SQL Introspection API

Restate exposes two tables that can be queried via [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).
The schema of these tables is described in the following.

## Table: `state`

| Column name         | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Example                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `partition_key`     | `UInt64` | Internal column that is used for partitioning the services invocations. Can be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                         |
| `service`           | `Utf8`   | The name of the invoked service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `foo.bar.Greeter`                                                       |
| `service_key`       | `Binary` | A binary, uninterpreted representation of the service key. You can use a more specific column based on the type of your key, such as `service_key_utf8` (for string keys), `service_key_uuid` for unkeyed services, or `service_key_int32` for integer keys. |                                                                         |
| `service_key_utf8`  | `Utf8`   | Only contains meaningful values when a service uses a `utf8` Restate key.                                                                                                                                                                                    | `bob`                                                                   |
| `service_key_int32` | `Int32`  | Only contains meaningful values when a service uses an `int32` Restate key.                                                                                                                                                                                  | `1337`                                                                  |
| `service_key_uuid`  | `Utf8`   | Only contains meaningful values for unkeyed Restate services.                                                                                                                                                                                                | `0189bab3b3397d828e979e2548980fa6`                                      |
| `service_key_json`  | `Utf8`   | Contains a JSON representation of the service key, which is a useful default if you're not sure of its shape.                                                                                                                                                | `{"name": "bob"}`                                                       |
| `key`               | `Utf8`   | The `utf8` user-supplied state key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | A snippet like  `ctx.set(“seen”, 1);` Will produce a value like: `seen` |
| `value`             | `Binary` | A binary, uninterpreted representation of the value. You can use the more specific column `value_utf8` if the value is a string.                                                                                                                             |                                                                         |
| `value_utf8`        | `Utf8`   | Only contains meaningful values when a service stores state as `utf8`. This is the case for Typescript services since the Typescript SDK serializes values as JSON.                                                                                          | `1`                                                                     |
