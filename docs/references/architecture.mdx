# Restate Architecture

Restate is designed to be extremely simple to get started with by delivering all the functionality in a single binary with minimal upfront configuration needs. In particular, when starting out by running Restate on a single node, you don't need to understand its internal architecture in a great level of detail.

As you begin to plan for more complex deployment scenarios, you will benefit from having a deeper understanding of the various components and how they fit together to support scalable and resilient clusters. The goal of this section is to introduce the terminology we use throughout the server documentation and inform the choices involved in configuring Restate clusters.


## Overview

Restate is implemented with a three-layered architecture: a control plane, distributed log, and processors.

### Control plane
This component stores all metadata about deployments (what services exist behind which endpoint addresses / URLs / ARNs) and is responsible for assigning the leaders to log partitions and processors.


### Distributed Log a.k.a Bifrost
Restate uses a distributed log, called Bifrost, to durably record all events in the system before acting on them, similar to the function of a write-ahead log (WAL) in a database system.
The design of Bifrost is based on the idea of a virtual consensus, as described in the [Delos paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi20-balakrishnan.pdf).
The consensus algorithm powering Bifrost is based on [Flexible Paxos](https://fpaxos.github.io/).

To support scale-out operations, Restate splits the services key-space across multiple partitions, backed by logs. Currently, we map one partition to one log, though this relationship may change in the future. Thus you will see references to both partition ids and log ids, depending on context, so be aware that these are distinct concepts even if they might be the same value.

Each Bifrost log is a chain of append-only segments. The control plane takes care of sealing prior segments and extending this chain. The individual segments are backed by loglets - currently, Bifrost ships with a local loglet suitable for single-node deployments, and a replicated loglet which supports clustered deployments.

### Processors

The Processors (also called Partition Processors) receive invocations, process events from the durable log, and interact with the services/functions containing the application/workflow logic. The Processors encapsulate the state machines for durable execution and invocation life-cycles.

The Processors maintain the “state of the world” which is derived from the events in the log. That state describes what invocations are ongoing, what is in the journal of each invocation, futures/promises, and the actual state of virtual objects. This state can be thought of as a materialized view that is deterministically derived from the log. The state is stored in RocksDB and periodically snapshotted to an object store, to bound the number of events to re-apply during a failure-recovery-catchup cycle.

## Nodes and roles

You'll see many mentions of the terms server and node throughout this documentation. Generally, we use the term "server" to refer to a running instance of the `restate-server` binary. This binary can host multiple functions. When you start a single-node Restate server, for example when doing some local development or testing, you are hosting all the essential features in a single process. These include accepting incoming requests, durably recording events, processing work (delegating invocations to services, handling key-value operations), as well as maintaining metadata used internally by the system.

At its simplest, running a cluster is not that different - multiple nodes cooperate to share the responsibilities we mentioned earlier. This is accomplished by having multiple copies of the server process running on separate machines, although it is possible to create test clusters on a single machine. **Nodes** are therefore distinct instances of the Restate server within a cluster.

Restate clusters are designed to scale out in support of large deployments. As you add more machines, it becomes wasteful to replicate all the functionality across all the machines in a cluster, since not all features need to scale out at the same rate. **Roles** control which features run on any given node, enabling specialization within the cluster.

Here is an overview of the different roles that can run on a node:

<img alt={"Restate Node internal architecture"} src={"/img/architecture/node_internal_architecture.png"}/>

- Metadata server: the source of truth for cluster-wide information
- Ingress: the entry point for external requests
- Log server: responsible for durably persisting the log
- Worker: houses the partition processors

## Metadata store

The Restate metadata store is part of the control plane and is the internal source of truth for node membership and responsibilities. It is essential to the correctness of the overall system: In a cluster this service enables distributed consensus about other components' configuration. All nodes in a Restate cluster must be able to access the metadata store, though not all members of the cluster need to be part of hosting it. Restate includes a built-in Raft-based metadata store which is hosted on all nodes running the `metadata-server` role.

The metadata store is designed to support relatively low volumes of read and write operations (at least compared to other parts of Restate), with the highest level of integrity and availability.

<h2>Ingress</h2>

External requests enter the Restate cluster via the HTTP ingress component, which runs on nodes assigned the `http-ingress` role. Compared to other roles, the HTTP ingress role does not involve long-lived state and it can move around relatively freely, since it only handles ongoing client connections.

<Admonition type="info" title={"Fine-grained ingress role"}>
    The fine-grained `http-ingress` role is a new addition in Restate 1.2. For backwards-compatibility, nodes running the `worker` role will continue to run the ingress function in version 1.2.

## Log servers

Log server nodes running the `log-server` role are responsible for durably persisting the log. If the log is the equivalent of a WAL, then partition stores are the materializations that enable efficient reads of the events (invocation journals, key-value data) that have been recorded. Depending on the configured **log replication** requirements, Restate will replicate log records to multiple log servers to persist a given log, and this will change over time to support maintenance and resizing of the cluster.


## Workers
Nodes assigned the `worker` role run the partition processors, which are the Restate components responsible for maintaining the partition store.
Partition processors can operate in either leader or follower mode.
Only a single leader for a given partition can be active at a time, and this is the sole processor that handles invocations to deployed services.
Followers keep up with the log without taking action, and are ready to take over in the event that the partition's leader becomes unavailable.
The overall number of processors per partition is configurable via the **partition replication** configuration option.

Partition processors replicate their state by following and applying the log for their partition.
If a processor needs to stop, for example for scheduled maintenance, it will typically catch up on the records it missed by reading them from the cluster's log servers once it comes back online.
Occasionally, a worker node might lose a disk - or you might need to grow your cluster by adding fresh nodes to it.
In these cases, it's far more efficient to obtain a **snapshot** of the partition state from a recent point in time than to replay all the missing log events.
Restate clusters can be configured to use an external **object store** as the snapshot repository, allowing partition processors to skip ahead in the log.
This also enables us to **trim logs** which might otherwise grow unboundedly.
