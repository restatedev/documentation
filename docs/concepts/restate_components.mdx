# Components

Handlers are bundled into components. There are two types of components in Restate: services and virtual objects.

Components run like regular RPC services (e.g. a NodeJS app in a Docker container).
Components can be written in any language for which there is an SDK available (currently [TypeScript](/category/typescript-sdk) and [Java](/category/java-sdk)).
There are two types of components: services and virtual objects.

## Services
Services expose a collection of handlers. The handlers of services are independent, stateless, and can be invoked concurrently.

**TODO: Add basic example for each language:**
- Code example: handler + service + endpoint
- Example of calling the service: curl request / typed client


## Virtual objects

Virtual objects expose a bundled set of handlers with access to K/V state stored in Restate.
Each virtual object has a key (unique identifier).
A virtual object can be accessed by its key, and each virtual object has its own isolated K/V state.
The handlers of a virtual object can read and write to the state of the object.
To ensure consistent writes to the state, Restate provides concurrency guarantees per key.
At most one handler can execute at a time for a given key.

**TODO: Add basic example for each language:**
- Code example that uses state: handler + object + endpoint
- Example of calling the object: curl request / typed client


## When to use what?

Use **services** when you don't need state or concurrency limits, but just have a function that you want to execute durably.

Use **virtual objects** when you need keyed concurrency guarantees, and if you want to store application state in Restate.
