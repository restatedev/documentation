# Restate Components

Restate gives you some components to build your application with.

## Services
- contain handlers
- similar to RPC: just functions you can invoke but now with durable execution
- no concurrency limits

## Virtual objects
- contain handlers
- keys: how are they specified and data types
- keys: how are they specified and data types
- locking
- concurrency limits/guarantees per key: only one concurrent operation per key. Unless shared context used.
- state


## Workflows
Single run function which specifies the workflow.
Has a clearly specified lifetime: while run() is in progress.

You can interact with it via signals: functions that are allowed to get executed concurrently with the workflow's run() method.

- locking: shared context vs exclusive context
- concurrency guarantees


## When to use what?

Services -> If you don't need state or concurrency limits, but just have a function that you want to execute durably.

Virtual objects -> If you need keyed concurrency guarantees, and if you want to store application state in Restate.

Workflows -> If you have a certain workflow that you want to execute durably, and you want to be able to interact with it via signals.
And you might want to do some extra things like keeping the history.
