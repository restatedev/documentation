# Restate Components

Restate lets you compose applications from two types of components: services and virtual objects.

## Services
Services expose a collection of handlers. Each handler is a function that you can invoke. Services are stateless and don't have any concurrency limits.

**TODO: Add basic example for each language:**
- Code example: handler + service + endpoint
- Example of calling the service: curl request / typed client


## Virtual objects

Virtual objects expose a bundled set of handlers with access to K/V state stored in Restate.
Each virtual object can be accessed by a key, and each key has its own state.
The handlers of a virtual object can read and write to the state of the object.
To ensure consistent writes to the state, Restate provides concurrency guarantees per key.
At most one handler can execute at a time for a given key.

**TODO: Add basic example for each language:**
- Code example that uses state: handler + object + endpoint
- Example of calling the object: curl request / typed client


## When to use what?

Use **services** when you don't need state or concurrency limits, but just have a function that you want to execute durably.

Use **virtual objects** when you need keyed concurrency guarantees, and if you want to store application state in Restate.
