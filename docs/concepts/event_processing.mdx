# Kafka event processing

When you want to execute a set of transactional steps per incoming Kafka event
( = non-big-data-analytics use cases for now).

- Durable processing/functions (like Flink or Spark but more light-weight)
- Flexible routing: also for complex flows (not DAG-like)
- For use cases requiring per-event transactional guarantees (>< analytics frameworks that checkpoint across large batches)
- Scheduling delayed actions based on events
- Durable side effects (for example coordinating reads/writes against multiple databases, fan-out, etc.)
- ...

E.g. complex processing pipelines with fine-grained transaction requirements, ETL / enriching events with info from other services/systems, executing workflows based on Kafka events,...

How it works
- Restate subscription to Kafka topic. Via curl
- Specify a function to execute per event

Explain how Kafka partitioning maps to function invocations
