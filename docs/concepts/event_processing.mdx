# Kafka event processing

- Durable processing/functions on Kafka events
- Flexible routing: you can create complex flows (doesn't need to be a DAG)
- For use cases requiring per-event transactional guarantees (>< analytics frameworks that checkpoint across batches)
- Scheduling delayed actions based on events
- Durable side effects (for example coordinating reads/writes against multiple databases, fan-out, etc.)

E.g. complex processing pipelines with fine-grained transaction requirements, ETL / enriching events with info from other services/systems, executing workflows based on Kafka events,...

How it works
- Restate subscription to Kafka topic. Via curl
- Specify a function to execute per event

Explain how Kafka partitioning maps to function invocations
