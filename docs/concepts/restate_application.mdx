# Restate Application
To understand how the different parts fit together, have a look at this helicopter view of a Restate application:

</center>

1. **Restate Server**: The server intercepts incoming requests and drives their execution till the end.
2. **Components**: Contain the handlers which process incoming requests.
3. **Invocation**: A request to execute a handler that is part of either a service, or a virtual object.

The only part we did not discuss yet is the Restate Server.
The Restate Server is the central piece of the application.
It sits in between the components and proxies invocations to them.
It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the components and the invocations.

The Restate Server has features of an event broker, a workflow engine, and a service mesh, while maintaining a few important characteristics:

        // Maybe instead put Restate icon inside the box

                The Restate Server runs as a single binary with zero dependencies. It runs with low operational overhead on any platform, also locally.

    },
    {
        title: 'Low latency',
        iconPath: '/img/rush.png', // https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/rush_7323234
        // Maybe put the rush signs behind the Restate icon

                Restate has an event-driven foundation. You can put it in the hot, latency-sensitive paths of your applications.

                Restate is written in Rust, to be self-contained and resource-efficient. It has a composable architecture to tailor to your needs.
