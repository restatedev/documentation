# Durable Building Blocks

<Admonition type="note" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Context">
    Distributed systems are inherently complex and failures are inevitable.
    Almost any application is a distributed system, since they are composed of different components that communicate over the network (e.g. services, databases, queues, etc).
    With every component, the number of possible failure scenarios increases: network partitions, hardware failures, timeouts, race conditions etc.
    Building reliable applications is a challenging task.
</Admonition>

Restate lets you write distributed applications that are resilient to failures.
It does this by providing a **distributed, durable version of common building blocks**.

For these building blocks, **Restate handles failure recovery, idempotency, state, and consistency**.
This way, you can implement otherwise tricky patterns in a few lines of code without worrying about these concerns.

Restate lets you implement your business logic in handlers.
These **handlers have access to these building blocks via the Restate SDK**, that is loaded as a dependency.

Let's have a look at a handler that processes food orders:
