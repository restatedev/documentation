# Components


This is what a Restate application looks like from a helicopter view:

<center>
    <img src="/img/restate-app.svg" alt="Application overview" width="50%"/>
</center>

1. **Restate Server**: The server intercepts incoming requests and drives their execution till the end.
2. **Components**: Contain the handlers which process incoming requests.
3. **Invocation**: A request to execute a handler that is part of either a service, or a virtual object.

As you can see, handlers are bundled into components.
Components run like regular RPC services (e.g. a NodeJS app in a Docker container).
Components can be written in any language for which there is an SDK available (currently [TypeScript](/category/typescript-sdk) and [Java](/category/java-sdk)).

There are two types of components in Restate:

| Services | Virtual objects |
|-----|-----|
| Set of independent handlers | Virtual object = Set of handlers + K/V state; Uniquely identified by a key|
| Stateless | Handlers share K/V state |
| No concurrency limits |  Single concurrent invocation per virtual object|
| Example use cases: <ul><li>Keeping multiple systems in sync</li><li>To benefit from idempotency</li><li>Short, stateless transformation functions</li></ul> | Example use cases: <ul><li>Atomic state machines</li><li>Digital twin</li><li>Locking mechanisms</li><li>Sequencing or ordering invocations</li></ul> |

## Services
Services expose a collection of handlers.
- The handlers of services are **independent**, **stateless**, and can be **invoked concurrently**.
- Handlers use the regular code and control flow, no custom DSLs.
- Handlers in services **take part in durable execution**.
They run to the end, even in the presence of failures.
Restate takes care of retries and recovers the handler to the point where it failed.

**Example**: You can use services for code that updates different systems and needs to make sure all updates are applied.
During retries, the service will not reapply the same update twice:

    You can then call this service:

            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/services.ts#<start_call_service>-<end_call_service>
            ```

            ```

            '{
                "request": {
                    "userId": "Sam Beckett",
                    "role": { "roleKey": "content-manager", "roleDescription": "Add/remove documents" },
                    "permissions" : [{ "permissionKey": "add", "setting": "allow" }]
                }
            }'
            ```

        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
</details>

## Virtual objects

Virtual objects expose a set of handlers with access to K/V state stored in Restate.
- A virtual object is **uniquely identified and accessed by its key**.
- Each virtual object has access to its own **isolated K/V state**, stored in Restate.
The handlers of a virtual object can read and write to the state of the object.
Restate delivers the state together with the request to the virtual object, so virtual objects have their state locally accessible without requiring any database connection or lookup.
State is exclusive, and atomically committed with the method execution.
- To ensure consistent writes to the state, Restate provides **concurrency guarantees**: at most one handler can execute at a time for a given virtual object.
This can also be used for example to implement a locking mechanism or to ensure single writer to a database row.

**Example** of a virtual object:

        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can then call this virtual object:

    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        ```typescript
        CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/virtual_objects.ts#<start_call_virtual_object>-<end_call_virtual_object>
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        GreeterRestateClient client = GreeterRestate.newClient(ctx);
        GreetResponse response = client.greet(request).await();
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">

        ```bash
        curl localhost:8080/greeter/greet   -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "key": "Mary" }'
        curl localhost:8080/greeter/greet   -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "key": "Barack" }'
        curl localhost:8080/greeter/ungreet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "key": "Mary" }'
        ```

## Restate Server
In between the components, sits the Restate Server. It proxies invocations to the components and manages their lifecycle.

The Restate Server is written in Rust, to be self-contained and resource-efficient.
It has an event-driven foundation. You can put it in the hot, latency-sensitive paths of your applications.

The main feature the Restate Server provides is Durable Execution. We dive into this in a [later section](/concepts/durable_execution).

The Restate Server runs as a single binary with zero dependencies. It runs with low operational overhead on any platform, also locally.
To deploy the Restate Server, have a look at these deployment guides:
- [Kubernetes](/deploy/kubernetes)
- [EC2](/deploy/lambda/self-hosted)
- [Restate Cloud](/deploy/restate_cloud) (Managed service)
