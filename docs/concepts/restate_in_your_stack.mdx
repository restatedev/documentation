# Restate Application
  - Explains the most important terms: *Restate server, services, invocation, CLI*
  - Shows a diagram of how things tie together
  - Restate sits in between services
  - Services can either be Restate services or embedded handlers in "external" services
  - Services can communicate with each other via RPC, or with the outside world via awakeables, and side effects
  - Restate services have the Restate SDK embedded in them, which handles the communication with the Restate server (to invoke a function, to log progress, to send back the response, etc.)

Restate Server has two endpoints:
- Admin server: CLI, registration, etc.
- Ingress: for invocations
