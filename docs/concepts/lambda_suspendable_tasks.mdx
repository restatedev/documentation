# Serverless Functions

Restate works well with AWS Lambda because:
link to website page on AWS Lambda workflows and blog post
https://restate.dev/blog/we-replaced-400-lines-of-stepfunctions-asl-with-40-lines-of-typescript-by-making-lambdas-suspendable/

## Suspensions
- What are they
- How do they work


## Lambda workflows as code
Long-running workflows become possible
- Lambda functions calling other Lambda functions
- Lambda functions sleeping/waiting for arbitrarily long time

No need for workflow orchestrators

## Deployment
### Restate Cloud


### CDK
