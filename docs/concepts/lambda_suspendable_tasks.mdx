# Long-running, suspendable FaaS

Suspensions
- What are they
- How do they work


## Lambda workflows as code
Long-running workflows become possible
- Lambda functions calling other Lambda functions
- Lambda functions sleeping/waiting for arbitrarily long time

No need for workflow orchestrators

## Deploying Restate on AWS with AWS Lambda services
Either with deploying a self-hosted version via CDK or with Restate Cloud

## Versioning benefits with AWS Lambda
Versioning works very well with Lambda.
No cost for keeping around old versions, just a file somewhere.
