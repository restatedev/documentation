# Durable Primitives

Restate provides a distributed, durable version of common primitives that can be used to build resilient, distributed applications.

You implement your business logic as handlers that use the Restate SDK to get access to these primitives.

## Durable <mark class="accent">functions</mark>

In Restate, you define your business logic as a handler function. The handler can be called by other handlers or by external systems.
Handlers take part in durable execution, meaning that Restate keeps track of their progress and recovers them to the previously reached state in case of failures.

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/food_ordering.ts
```

## Durable <mark class="accent">RPC</mark>
Call other handlers in a resilient way.
When a failure happens, Restate handles retries and recovers partial progress.

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/durable_promises.ts#<start_rpc>-<end_rpc>
```


## Durable <mark class="accent">queues</mark>
Send one-way messages to other handlers in a resilient way.
When a failure happens, Restate handles retries and recovers partial progress.

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/durable_promises.ts#<start_queue>-<end_queue>
```


## Durable <mark class="accent">timers</mark>
Durably sleep or schedule a function to be executed at a later time.

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/durable_promises.ts#<start_timers>-<end_timers>
```



## Durable <mark class="accent">promises</mark>
Register a webhook in Restate and receive a durable promise that will be resolved when the webhook is triggered.

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/durable_promises.ts#<start_awakeable>-<end_awakeable>
```


## Durable <mark class="accent">side effects</mark>
Store the result of a computation in Restate. The result gets replayed in case of failures and the function is not executed again.

```ts
CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/durable_promises.ts#<start_side_effect>-<end_side_effect>
```

## Durable <mark class="accent">state</mark>

Store the state of your application in Restate. State changes are persisted and get replayed in case of failures.
