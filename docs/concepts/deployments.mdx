# Deployments & Versions

Visualization of the service deployment hierarchy:

## Deployments
= A deployment hosts a given revision of one or more RPC services.
Deployments are immutable by default, to update a service, the user must register a new deployment.

- Revisions / Versions
- Endpoints

Types of deployments:
- Restate Lambda Handler
- Restate HTTP deployment endpoint

Refer to other page on Lambda for more info on how they execute differently.

## Versioning
Explain how versioning Restate applications works

Versioning works very well with Lambda.
No cost for keeping around old versions, just a file somewhere.

Invocation gets retried on same version

You can find info on draining in CLI

## Scaling and load balancing
- Lambda & Knative
- Kubernetes autoscaling
- L7 load balancing
