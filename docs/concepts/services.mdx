This is what a Restate application looks like from a helicopter view:

<center>
    <img src="/img/restate-app.svg" alt="Application overview" width="50%"/>
</center>

1. **Restate Server**: The server intercepts incoming requests and drives their execution till the end.
2. **Services**: Contain the handlers which process incoming requests.
3. **Invocation**: A request to execute a handler that is part of either a service, or a virtual object.

As you can see, handlers are bundled into services.
Services run like regular RPC services (e.g. a NodeJS app in a Docker container).
Services can be written in any language for which there is an SDK available (currently [TypeScript](/category/typescript-sdk) and [Java/Kotlin](/category/javakotlin-sdk)).

There are three types of services in Restate:

## Services

Services expose a collection of handlers:

            ---

            ```diff focus=10,16
            ```

            Restate makes sure that **handlers run to completion**, even in the presence of failures.
            Restate logs the **results of actions** in the system.
            Restate takes care of retries and recovers the handler to the point where it failed.

            ---

            ```diff focus=4,6,7,18,19,20
            ```

            The handlers of services are **independent** and can be **invoked concurrently**.

            ---

            ```diff focus=11:13,15,17
            ```

            Handlers use the regular code and control flow, no custom DSLs.

            ---

            ```diff
            ```

            Service handlers **don't have access to Restate's K/V store**.

In the example, we use a Restate service to update different systems and to make sure all updates are applied.
During retries, the service will not reapply the same update twice.

## Virtual objects

Virtual objects expose a set of handlers with access to K/V state stored in Restate.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        <CH.Spotlight className={"spotlight-long-code"}>

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/virtual_objects.ts#<start_virtual_object>-<end_virtual_object>
            ```

            ---

            ```diff focus=4,6,7,11,12,14,20,21,22
            ```

            A virtual object is **uniquely identified and accessed by its key**.

            ---

            ```diff focus=8:10,15,17,19
            ```

            Each virtual object has access to its own **isolated K/V state**, stored in Restate.
            The handlers of a virtual object can read and write to the state of the object.
            Restate delivers the state together with the request to the virtual object, so virtual objects have their state locally accessible without requiring any database connection or lookup.
            State is exclusive, and atomically committed with the method execution.

            ---

            ```diff focus=4,6,7,9,12,14,17,21,22,23
            ```

            To ensure consistent writes to the state, Restate provides **concurrency guarantees**: at most one handler can execute at a time for a given virtual object.
            This can also be used for example to implement a locking mechanism or to ensure single writer to a database row.

            ```

            A virtual object is **uniquely identified and accessed by its key**.

            ---

            ```diff focus=9:11,17,19,21
            ```

            Each virtual object has access to its own **isolated K/V state**, stored in Restate.

## Workflows

A workflow is a special type of Virtual Object that can be used to implement a set of steps that needs to be executed durably.
They have some added capabilities such as signaling, querying, additional invocation options, and a longer retention time in the CLI.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

        <CH.Spotlight className={"spotlight-long-code"}>

            ```typescript
            CODE_LOAD::ts/src/concepts/workflow.ts#<start_workflow>-<end_workflow>
            ```

            ---

            ```diff focus=4:25
            ```

            A workflow has a **`run` handler** that implements the **workflow logic**.
            The `run` handler runs exactly once per workflow ID (object).

            ---

            ```diff focus=16,22,31
            ```

            You can **query the workflow** by defining other handlers in the same object.
            For example, you can store state in the workflow object, and query it from other handlers.

            ---

            ```diff focus=15,27:29
            ```

            You can **signal the workflow**, to send information to it, via [Durable Promises](/develop/ts/workflows#signaling-workflows).
            For example, the payment provider signals the workflow that the payment was successful by calling the `paymentWebhook`.

            ```

            ---

            ```diff focus=8:28
            ```

            A workflow has a **`run` handler** that implements the **workflow logic**.
            The `run` handler runs exactly once per workflow ID (object).

            ---

            ```diff focus=20,25,35:38
            ```

            You can **query the workflow** by defining other handlers in the same object.
            For example, you can store state in the workflow object, and query it from other handlers.

            ---

            ```diff focus=18,30:33
            ```

            You can **signal the workflow**, to send information to it, via [Durable Promises](/develop/ts/workflows#signaling-workflows).

<Admonition type="note">
    The `run` handler is the only handler that can **write K/V state**.
    The other handlers are able to run concurrently to the `run` handler, and can get state but cannot set it.

## Restate Server

In between the services, sits the Restate Server. It proxies invocations to the services and manages their lifecycle.

The Restate Server is written in Rust, to be self-contained and resource-efficient.
It has an event-driven foundation. You can put it in the hot, latency-sensitive paths of your applications.

The main feature the Restate Server provides is Durable Execution. We dive into this in a [later section](/concepts/durable_execution).

The Restate Server runs as a single binary with zero dependencies. It runs with low operational overhead on any platform, also locally.
To deploy the Restate Server, have a look at these deployment guides:

- [Kubernetes](/deploy/kubernetes)
- [EC2](/deploy/lambda/self-hosted)
