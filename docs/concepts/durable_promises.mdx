# Durable Building Blocks
Restate provides a distributed, durable version of common coding primitives. You can use these to build resilient, distributed applications.

You implement your business logic in handlers. These handlers have access to these building blocks via the Restate SDK, that is loaded as a dependency.

Let's have a look at a handler that processes food orders:

    <p class="font-size-90">Handlers take part in durable execution, meaning that Restate keeps track of their progress and recovers them to the previously reached state in case of failures.</p>

    <p class="font-size-90">Handlers can call other handlers in a resilient way.
    When a failure happens, Restate handles retries and recovers partial progress.</p>

    <p class="font-size-90">Handlers can send one-way messages to other handlers in a resilient way.
        When a failure happens, Restate handles retries and recovers partial progress.</p>

    <p class="font-size-90">Handlers can sleep or schedule a function to be executed at a later time. When running on serverless platforms, Restate lets the handler suspend while waiting to free up resources. </p>
