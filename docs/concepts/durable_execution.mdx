# Durable Execution

## Why?
Distributed systems are inherently complex and failures are inevitable.
Almost any application is a distributed system, since they are composed of different components that communicate over the network (e.g. services, databases, queues, etc).
With every component, the number of possible failure scenarios increases: network partitions, hardware failures, software bugs, etc.
Building reliable applications that can recover from failures is a challenging task.

## What?
Durable execution is a way to ensure that your application can recover from failures and continue to make progress.
Durable execution is the act of tracking code execution to enable recovery of partial progress in case of failures.
Restate implements durable execution by keeping track of the progress of execution in a central, persisted log that can be replayed in case of failures.

## How?
Restate uses a combination of a server and SDK libraries to provide durable execution.
The SDKs are responsible for tracking the progress of the execution and sending it to the runtime.
The Restate server is responsible for storing the progress in a durable log and triggering retries in case of failures.
When the Restate server triggers a retry, it sends the progress log to the SDK, which replays the log to continue the execution from where it left off.

**TODO: Add a diagram showing how durable execution works in Restate with explanation. Similar to homepage**
