# Invocations

An invocation is a request to execute a handler that is part of either a service, or a virtual object.

There are three ways to invoke a handler:

<FeatureList features={[
    {
        title: 'HTTP requests',
        iconPath: '/img/http-icon.svg',
        description: (
            <p>
                Send a request to the Restate Server (port <code>8080</code>), with the handler name in the path, and the payload body.
                <br/>
                <a href="/invoke/http">Learn more</a>
            </p>
        ),
    },
    {
        title: 'Programmatically',
        iconPath: '/img/code-icon.svg',
        description: (
            <p>
                Use the SDK to send requests within Restate handlers. Or use generated HTTP clients anywhere else.
                <br/>
                <a href="/invoke/clients">Learn more</a>
            </p>
        ),
    },
    {
        title: 'Kafka events',
        iconPath: '/img/kafka-icon.svg',
        description: (
            <p>
                Restate subscribes to a Kafka topic, and invokes a handler should for each message that arrives.
                <br/>
                <a href="/invoke/kafka">Learn more</a>
            </p>
        ),
    },
]}/>

All invocations are proxied through the Restate Server, which registers the request, routes the request to the correct handler, and drives the execution of the handler.

Invocations get a unique identifier. This identifier is used to track the progress of the invocation, and lets you correlate logs and metrics.

## Idempotent invocations
For HTTP requests, you can add an idempotency key to the header to make the invocation idempotent.
Restate will then deduplicate requests with the same idempotency key, and will only execute the handler once.
Duplicate requests will get the same response as the first request, or will latch on to the first invocation if it's still running.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/GreeterService/greet \
# !focus
  -H 'idempotency-key: ad5472esg4dsg525dssdfa5loi' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '"Hi"'
```

Note that, you don't need idempotency tokens for invocations that are invoked programmatically or via Kafka, as Restate will make sure that they are executed only once.

## Inspecting invocations
Restate proxies and manages inbound as well as service-to-service invocations.
This makes it a great source of observability data for your application.
You can inspect invocations via the CLI.

Restate also exposes traces via OpenTelemetry, which can be sent to your observability platform of choice (e.g. Jaeger).
Have a look at the [tracing documentation](/operate/monitoring/tracing) for more information.

## Cancelling and killing invocations

The Restate CLI allows you to cancel or kill invocations.
If necessary, you can register compensating actions in your handlers to ensure that the system remains consistent amid cancellations (blog post on [graceful cancellations](https://restate.dev/blog/graceful-cancellations-how-to-keep-your-application-and-workflow-state-consistent/)).

For cancellations, Restate will gracefully stop the handler by executing all compensation actions.
For kills, Restate will immediately stop the handler without executing any compensation actions.
