Two main type of invocations: inbound invocations and service-to-service invocations.

## Inbound invocations

### One-way inbound invocation

### Idempotent invocations
- gets executed exactly-once
- latch on later to continue waiting for the response or to get the result if finished

### Invocation ID

## Service-to-service invocations
- one-way calls
- request-response calls
- delayed calls


## Inspecting invocations
- CLI
