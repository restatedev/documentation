# AWS Lambda + TypeScript

## Deploying services as AWS Lambda functions

You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

<Admonition type="tip">
The easiest way to run Restate handlers on AWS Lambda is to use the [Restate CDK construct library](/deploy/lambda/cdk).
</Admonition>

To deploy a Restate service as a Lambda function, you can follow the [guidelines of AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-package.html)
for deploying plain TypeScript NodeJS functions. Restate does not add any complexity to this. You build a zip file containing the application code and dependencies and upload this to AWS Lambda. If you are using the Restate node template, then you can create a zip file with:

```shell
npm run bundle
```

AWS Lambda assumes that the handler can be found under `index.handler` in the uploaded code.
By default, this is also the case for the Lambda functions developed with the Restate SDK.

## Discovery of services

To let Restate discover the services, execute the following curl command,
pointed at the Restate runtime and with the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate deployments register "arn:aws:lambda:my-region:123456789101:function:my-function:my-version"
```

Replace the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```shell
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"arn": "arn:aws:lambda:my-region:123456789101:function:my-function:my-version"}'
```

Replace `<RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>` and the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

## Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to deploy a greeter service written with the Restate TypeScript SDK on AWS Lambda.

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
    - TypeScript: Latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 and [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7
    - Optional but recommended: [Install the Restate Server & CLI](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally)
    - An AWS account with permissions for Lambda.
</Admonition>

<Step stepLabel="1" title={<span><a href={"/get_started/quickstart"}>Get the Greeter service template</a></span>}/>

<Step stepLabel="2" title={<span><a href={"/develop/ts/serving#creating-a-lambda-handler"}>Convert the endpoint to a Lambda handler</a></span>}/>
<Step stepLabel="3" title="Create a zip file from the code base">
    Now, we need to create a zip file that includes the service code and the required dependencies to run it.
    To build the code and make the zip file, do

    ```shell
    npm run bundle
    ```
</Step>
<Step stepLabel="4" title="Deploying the Lambda function via the AWS console">
Go to the Lambda UI in the AWS console. Click on `Create function`.
Fill in the name of your function. You can leave the settings to the default:

![Create function](/img/create-function.png)

Click `Create function`.

You should now see a function overview with your new function in it.

![Function overview](/img/function-overview.png)

The next step is uploading the zip file with our function code.
Open the `Code` tab in the section below the function overview.
Click on `Upload from` and select your zip file.
You should now see the uploaded code in the browser editor.

By default, Lambda assumes that your handler can be found under `index.handler`.
So this means that you should have the Restate Lambda handler assigned to `export const handler` in the file `src/app.ts`, as shown in the code.
This handler will then be included in `index.js` after creating the zip, and be used by AWS Lambda as the entry point of the Lambda function.
To change that you can scroll down to `Runtime settings` and change the handler reference.

Our Lambda function should now be working!
</Step>
<Step stepLabel="5" title="Testing your Lambda function">
The AWS console lets you test your Lambda functions.
Go to your Lambda function and click on the `Test` tab.
Here, you can send requests to your Lambda function.

You can test service registration by sending this event JSON to your Lambda function:

```json
{
  "resource": "",
  "stageVariables": null,
  "body": "",
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "application/proto"
  },
  "queryStringParameters": {},
  "pathParameters": {},
  "requestContext": {},
  "multiValueHeaders": {},
  "multiValueQueryStringParameters": {},
  "path": "/discover",
  "isBase64Encoded": true
}
```

The response should have status code 200 with a long base64 encoded body representing the services,
methods and Protobuf metadata behind the Lambda endpoint.

To test the greet method, you can send the following event JSON:

```json
{
  "resource": "",
  "stageVariables": null,
  "body": "AAAAAAAAABsKEAGI6GNZE3i3iJ6H90kF2CsSBQRQZXRlGAEEAAABAAAACHIGCgRQZXRl",
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "application/restate"
  },
  "queryStringParameters": {},
  "pathParameters": {},
  "requestContext": {},
  "multiValueHeaders": {},
  "multiValueQueryStringParameters": {},
  "path": "/invoke/org.example.Greeter/MultiWord",
  "isBase64Encoded": true
}
```

The response should be the following:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "application/restate"
  },
  "statusCode": 200,
  "isBase64Encoded": true,
  "body": "BAEAAAAAAA5yDAoKSGVsbG8gUGV0ZQ=="
}
```

The body is the base64 encoded string of the response, and stands for `{"value":"Hello Pete"}`.
</Step>
<Step stepLabel="6" title="Running Restate Server">
Run the Restate Server via one of the options listed in [the docs](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally).

You don't necessarily need to run the Restate runtime on AWS, but it does need to be able to obtain credentials to invoke your Lambda.
You can run the Restate runtime locally in a Docker container to test your Lambda function, using your local AWS creds (defined in ~/.aws).

```shell
docker run -e AWS_PROFILE -v ~/.aws/:/root/.aws --name restate_dev --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

</Step>
<Step stepLabel="7" title="Discovering the services behind the Lambda endpoint">

Connect to the Restate (e.g. via an SSH session if it is running on EC2) runtime and execute the registration command:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate deployments register <LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN>
```

Replace the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"arn": "<LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN>"  }'
```

Replace the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When executing this command, you should see the discovered services printed out!

</Step>
<Step stepLabel="8" title="Invoke the handler">

```shell
curl localhost:8080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Hi"'
```

The Greeter service should say hi back.
</Step>
<Step end={true} stepLabel="ðŸŽ‰" title="Congratulations, you managed to run your first Restate Lambda handler!"/>


Here are some next steps for you to try:

- Add a new method to the greeter function and redeploy the Lambda function with the new methods enabled.
- Create and deploy a new Lambda function that calls the greeter function.
