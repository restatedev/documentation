# AWS Lambda + TypeScript

## Deploying services as AWS Lambda functions

You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

<Admonition type="tip">
The easiest way to run Restate handlers on AWS Lambda is to use the [Restate CDK construct library](/deploy/lambda/cdk).
</Admonition>

To deploy a Restate service as a Lambda function, you can follow the [guidelines of AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-package.html)
for deploying plain TypeScript NodeJS functions. Restate does not add any complexity to this. You build a zip file containing the application code and dependencies and upload this to AWS Lambda. If you are using the Restate node template, then you can create a zip file with:

```shell
npm run bundle
```

AWS Lambda assumes that the handler can be found under `index.handler` in the uploaded code.
By default, this is also the case for the Lambda functions developed with the Restate SDK.

## Discovery of services

To let Restate discover the services, execute the following curl command,
pointed at the Restate runtime and with the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate deployments register "arn:aws:lambda:my-region:123456789101:function:my-function:my-version"
```

Replace the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```shell
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"arn": "arn:aws:lambda:my-region:123456789101:function:my-function:my-version"}'
```

Replace `<RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>` and the Lambda function ARN in the data field.

## Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to deploy a greeter service written with the Restate TypeScript SDK on AWS Lambda.

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
    - TypeScript: Latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 and [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7
    - Optional but recommended: [Install the Restate Server & CLI](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally)
    - An AWS account with permissions for Lambda.
</Admonition>

<Step stepLabel="1" title={<span><a href={"/get_started/quickstart"}>Get the Greeter service template</a></span>}/>

<Step stepLabel="2" title={<span><a href={"/develop/ts/serving#creating-a-lambda-handler"}>Convert the endpoint to a Lambda handler</a></span>}/>
<Step stepLabel="3" title="Create a zip file from the code base">
    Now, we need to create a zip file that includes the service code and the required dependencies to run it.
    To build the code and make the zip file, do

    ```shell
    npm run bundle
    ```
</Step>
<Step stepLabel="4" title="Deploying the Lambda function via the AWS console">
Go to the Lambda UI in the AWS console. Click on `Create function`.
Fill in the name of your function. You can leave the settings to the default.

    <details>
        <summary>View</summary>

        ![Create function](/img/create-function.png)

    </details>

Click `Create function`.

You should now see a function overview with your new function in it.

    <details>
        <summary>View</summary>

        ![Function overview](/img/function-overview.png)
    </details>

The next step is uploading the zip file with our function code.
Open the `Code` tab in the section below the function overview.
Click on `Upload from` and select your zip file.
You should now see the uploaded code in the browser editor.

By default, Lambda assumes that your handler can be found under `index.handler`.
So this means that you should have the Restate Lambda handler assigned to _`export const handler`_ in the file `src/app.ts`, as shown in the code.
This handler will then be included in `index.js` after creating the zip, and be used by AWS Lambda as the entry point of the Lambda function.
To change that you can scroll down to `Runtime settings` and change the handler reference.

Finally, let's publish a new version of our Lambda function.
Go to the tab `Versions` and click `Publish new version` and then `Publish`.

Our Lambda function should now be working!
</Step>
<Step stepLabel="5" title="Running Restate Server">
Run the Restate Server via one of the options listed in [the docs](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally).

<details>

    <summary>Running Restate in a Docker container</summary>

    If you run Restate in a Docker container, then make sure it can using your local AWS creds (defined in ~/.aws):

    ```shell
    docker run -e AWS_PROFILE -v ~/.aws/:/root/.aws --name restate_dev --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
    ```
</details>


</Step>
<Step stepLabel="6" title="Registering the service">

Connect to the Restate (e.g. via an SSH session if it is running on EC2) runtime and execute [the registration command](/operate/registration):

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell 
restate deployments register arn:aws:lambda:eu-central-1:000000000000:function:my-greeter:1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```shell
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"arn": "arn:aws:lambda:eu-central-1:000000000000:function:my-greeter:1"  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure you replace the Lambda function ARN with the one you deployed, including it's version tag (here `1`).

When executing this command, you should see the discovered services printed out!

</Step>
<Step stepLabel="7" title="Invoke the handler">

```shell
curl localhost:8080/Greeter/greet -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '"Hi"'
```

The Greeter service should say hi back.
</Step>
<Step end={true} stepLabel="ðŸŽ‰" title="Congratulations, you managed to run your first Restate Lambda handler!"/>


Here are some next steps for you to try:

- Add a new method to the greeter function and redeploy the Lambda function with the new methods enabled.
- Create and deploy a new Lambda function that calls the greeter function.
