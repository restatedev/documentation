# AWS Lambda + TypeScript

You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

First, make sure you create a Lambda endpoint in your Restate service, as described in the [TypeScript SDK docs](/develop/ts/serving#creating-a-lambda-handler).

<Admonition type="tip">
The easiest way to run Restate handlers on AWS Lambda is to use the [Restate CDK construct library](/deploy/services/faas/lambda/cdk).
</Admonition>

To deploy a Restate service as a Lambda function, you can follow the [guidelines of AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-package.html)
for deploying plain TypeScript NodeJS functions. Restate does not add any complexity to this. You build a zip file containing the application code and dependencies and upload this to AWS Lambda. If you are using the Restate node template, then you can create a zip file with:

```shell
npm run bundle
```

AWS Lambda assumes that the handler can be found under `index.handler` in the uploaded code.
By default, this is also the case for the Lambda functions developed with the Restate SDK.

<Admonition type="info" title={"Lambda service registration"}>
    Once your Lambda handler is deployed, register it with Restate as described in the [registration docs](/operate/registration#registering-deployments).
    Make sure you first publish a new version of the Lambda function before registering it with Restate.
