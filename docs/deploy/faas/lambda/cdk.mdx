# AWS Lambda with CDK

## Deploying Restate services as AWS Lambda functions

You can deploy your Restate service handlers as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) Functions.
The [Restate CDK support library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-cdk) provides convenient constructs
for managing Restate service deployments on AWS Lambda.

The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) provides an elegant way to define your cloud
application infrastructure in a familiar programming language. Currently, we support CDK projects built in TypeScript,
but you can deploy Restate handlers in any language supported by a Restate SDK. CDK is often used to manage serverless
application stacks, and the Restate CDK constructs are the easiest method to deploy and manage Restate services on AWS
Lambda.

If you don't have an existing CDK project, follow the CDK [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html)
page to set one up.

### Adding the Restate CDK support library

Add the Restate CDK support library to your project:

```shell
npm install @restatedev/restate-cdk
```

### Deploy your handlers to AWS Lambda

Define one or more Lambda functions in your CDK stack to model the service handlers in your chosen language. Depending
on the SDK and programming language, you may need an additional build process such as Gradle, to bundle your business
logic in a Lambda-deployable artifact. To deploy Restate services we use the standard CDK Lambda constructs.

For more information about setting up an IAM role that works with Restate Cloud, please see the section on
[AWS Lambda services](/deploy/cloud#aws-lambda-services).

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default>

For TypeScript/JavaScript services, you can use the [`NodejsFunction`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs-readme.html)
construct to transpile and bundle all the required dependencies.

```typescript
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
import { NodejsFunction } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs";

const service = new NodejsFunction(scope, "RestateService", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
  architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
  entry: "handler", // use the path to your service handler
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm" label="Java" default>

For Java/Kotlin services, you can use the regular function construct with a supported JVM runtime. This example assumes
that some build process has already produced a "fat JAR" artifact containing all the required dependencies. For an
example of how to do this in Gradle, refer to the [hello-world-lambda-cdk](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/blob/main/templates/kotlin-gradle-lambda-cdk/lambda/build.gradle.kts)
project.

```typescript
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";

const serviceHandler: lambda.Function = new lambda.Function(scope, "RestateService", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.JAVA_21,
  architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(".../lambda-all.jar"), // path to the "fat JAR" artifact
  handler: "com.example.service.LambdaHandler", // fully qualified handler class name
  timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10), // the default timeout of 3s may not be enough for initialization!
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Optional: Deploy a self-hosted Restate server

Restate is [very easy to deploy](/deploy/overview), and we provide a CDK construct to make it super simple to deploy
a self-hosted development server on Amazon EC2.
See [Deploying Restate on Amazon EC2 with CDK](/deploy/faas/lambda/self-hosted) for more information on how to
deploy Restate using CDK.
Alternatively, you can deploy and register services by targeting an existing Restate admin endpoint.

### Deploy Restate services to a Restate environment

To enable Lambda handlers to receive Restate requests, we need to create a deployment in the desired Restate environment.
To automate Lambda endpoint registration, use the `ServiceDeployer` construct in your stack which will take
care of creating/updating Restate Deployments any time you deploy changes. Restate uses Lambda versioning to consistently
target the same function configuration from a given deployment revision. This is a quiescent component: it deploys a custom
CloudFormation resource provider which is handles deployment events only if any related resources in your CDK stack change.

Use the `deployService` method to tell the deployer about each service endpoint that you want to register.
If the target Restate environment is only accessible in a VPC, you will need to configure the service deployer with the appropriate
details.

<Admonition type={"caution"} title={"Implicit permission grant"}>
    Calling `deployService` grants `lambda:InvokeFunction` to the environment's invoker role by default.
    You can disable this behavior using the `skipInvokeFunctionGrant` option.
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-hosted Restate construct" default>

The `SingleNodeRestateDeployment` deploys Restate environment backed by a single EC2 instance and is suitable for
development and testing purposes.

<Admonition type={"caution"} title={"EC2 instance creation"}>
    The EC2 instance will be created in the default VPC unless otherwise specified.
    The instance will be assigned a public IP address.
</Admonition>

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-cdk";

const restateEnvironment = new restate.SingleNodeRestateDeployment(scope, "Restate", {});

const deployer = new restate.ServiceDeployer(stack, "ServiceDeployer");
deployer.deployService("RestateService", serviceHandler.currentVersion, restateEnvironment);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom" label="Custom environment">

You can specify the target Restate environment explicitly:

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-cdk";

const restateEnvironment = RestateEnvironment.fromAttributes({
  adminUrl: environment.adminUrl,
  invokerRole: restateHandlerInvokerRole, // deployService grants invoke permissions for each registered handler
  authTokenSecretArn: restateAdminAuthToken.secretFullArn, // optional
});

const deployer = new restate.ServiceDeployer(stack, "ServiceDeployer");
deployer.deployService("RestateService", serviceHandler.currentVersion, restateEnvironment);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Complete examples

You can use the following examples as references for your own CDK projects:

- [hello-world-lambda-cdk (Kotlin)](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/README.md#aws-lambda) -
  provides a simple example of a Lambda-deployed handler with a CDK stack.
- [Restate Holiday](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-holiday) - a more complex example of a fictional reservation
  service demonstrating the Saga orchestration pattern across multiple Restate services implemented in TypeScript
