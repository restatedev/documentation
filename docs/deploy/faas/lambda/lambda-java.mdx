# AWS Lambda + Java

You can run your Restate services as serverless functions on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

<Admonition type="tip">
The easiest way to run Restate handlers on AWS Lambda is to use the [Restate CDK construct library](/deploy/faas/lambda/cdk).
</Admonition>

Make sure you have defined a Lambda handler in your service code, as explained in the [serving docs](/develop/java/serving#creating-a-lambda-handler).

Configure the build tool to generate Fat-JARs so that all dependencies can be deployed to AWS Lambda as a single bundle. For example, using Gradle:

```kotlin
plugins {
  // ...
  // The shadow plugin generates a shadow JAR ready for AWS Lambda
  id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow").version("7.1.2")
  // ...
}

// It's important to correctly merge log4j plugin and extension metadata, otherwise certain logging features may break
tasks.withType<ShadowJar> {
    transform(Log4j2PluginsCacheFileTransformer::class.java)
    transform(ServiceFileTransformer::class.java)
}
```

For a complete Gradle build script example please see the example [hello-world-lambda-cdk](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/blob/main/kotlin/integrations/kotlin-gradle-lambda-cdk/lambda/build.gradle.kts).

Now build the Fat-JAR. For example, using Gradle:

```shell
gradle shadowJar
```

Then upload the generated Jar to AWS Lambda, and configure `MyLambdaHandler` as the Lambda class in the AWS UI.


<Admonition type="info" title={"Lambda service registration"}>
    Once your Lambda handler is deployed, register it with Restate as described in the [registration docs](/operate/registration#registering-deployments).
    Make sure you first publish a new version of the Lambda function before registering it with Restate.
</Admonition>
