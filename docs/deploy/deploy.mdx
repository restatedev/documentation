# Overview

Restate applications consist of two parts: the Restate [server](#restate-server) and the [services](#restate-services) it hosts:

![Restate overview](/img/deployment_overview.svg)

This page describes how to deploy Restate and Restate services.

## Restate Server

The Restate Server is a single binary that contains everything you need to host an environment. See the [Installation page](/develop/local_dev) for various ways of obtaining it.

There are a few options for deploying the Restate Server:
- [Cluster deployment](/deploy/server/cluster)
- [Self-host a single-node Restate server on AWS](/deploy/server/self-hosted)
- [Self-host a single-pod Restate server on Kubernetes](/deploy/server/kubernetes)
- [Use Restate Cloud](/deploy/server/cloud)
- [Run locally](/develop/local_dev)

<Admonition type="note" title="Architectural overview">
    To understand the design and architecture of Restate, it might be helpful to read through the [architecture reference](/references/architecture).
</Admonition>

The server will store metadata and RocksDB data under `./restate-data/<NODE-NAME>`.
`<NODE-NAME>` is the name of the Restate server, which is set by the `--node-name` flag (defaults to hostname).
The server requires outbound connectivity to the services you deploy in order to discover and send requests to them.

### Exposed Ports

The server process exposes a set of services by default, available on different ports:

| Name     | Port | Description                                                                                                                    | Protocol                                      |
|----------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| NodeCtl  | 5122 | Control port for Restate Server nodes                                                                                          | gRPC + HTTP for Prometheus metrics `/metrics` |
| Ingress  | 8080 | Acts as an API gateway for all services registered with Restate                                                                |                                               |
| Admin    | 9070 | Allows for CRUD operations on service/service deployment metadata, eg for service registration                                 | REST                                          |
| Postgres | 9071 | Exposes Restate RocksDB read-only storage operations using the Postgres protocol. See [Introspection](/operate/introspection). | Postgres                                      |

## Restate services

Restate services are deployed as _Service deployments_.
A service deployment can be a Kubernetes pod, a Lambda function, a Knative Service, or any other process reachable at a specific URL.
The URL (including path prefix) MUST be **unique**, meaning that no two deployments with the same URL can be registered with Restate.

Service deployments are considered **immutable** and to be reachable throughout the entire lifecycle of an invocation.
To deploy any change to a service, you should create a new deployment with a new URL.
See the [versioning documentation](/operate/versioning) for more details on how to update services.
