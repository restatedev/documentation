# Growing the cluster

You can expand an existing cluster by adding new nodes after it has been started.
To do this, launch a new node with the same `cluster-name` and specify at least one existing node's address in `metadata-client.addresses`.
This allows the new node to discover the metadata servers and join the cluster.

<Admonition type="note" title="Growing the cluster in the future">
    If you plan to scale your cluster over time, we strongly recommend enabling snapshotting.
    Without it, newly added nodes may not be fully utilized by the system.
    See the [snapshotting documentation](/operate/data-backup#snapshotting) for more details.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Shrinking the cluster">
    Currently, removing nodes from the cluster is not supported. Once a node joins the cluster,
    it cannot be removed or stopped. Support for shrinking the cluster will be added in the future.
</Admonition>

## Modify Cluster Configuration
A Restate cluster can initially be started with a single node. Follow the cluster deployment instructions and ensure that `default-log-replication` is set to 1 in the configuration:

```toml
[bifrost.replicated-loglet]
# Replicate the data to 1 node. The cluster in this
# cannot tolerate the failure of any nodes.
default-log-replication = 1
```

Later after [adding new nodes](#), you may want to update the cluster’s replication settings to take advantage of the additional nodes and improve fault tolerance.
You can modify the configuration using the `restatectl config` command

### Viewing Cluster Configuration
To check the current cluster settings, run:

```shell
restatectl config get
```

Example output
```
⚙️ Cluster Configuration
├ Number of partitions: 8
├ Partition replication: *
└ Logs Provider: replicated
 ├ Log replication: {node: 1}
 └ Nodeset size: 0
```

### Updating Cluster Configuration
To increase log replication to 2, run:
```shell
restatectl config set --log-replication 2
```
<Admonition type="tip" title="help">
Run `restatectl config set --help` to see all available configuration options.
</Admonition>

Example output:
```
  ⚙️ Cluster Configuration
  ├ Number of partitions: 8
  ├ Partition replication: *
  └ Logs Provider: replicated
 - ├ Log replication: {node: 1}
 + ├ Log replication: {node: 2}
   └ Nodeset size: 0


? Apply changes? (y/n) › no
```
Press `y` to confirm and apply the new configuration.

### Verifying the Update
To check if the logs have been reconfigured, run:
```shell
restatectl logs list
```
Example output
```
Log chain v5
└ Logs Provider: replicated
 ├ Log replication: {node: 2}
 └ Nodeset size: 0

 7     2         Replicated  7_2        {node: 2}    N1:2       [N1, N2, N3]
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="logs list">
You may need to run `restatectl logs list` multiple times before all logs reflect the updated replication setting. If the update takes longer than expected, check the node logs for errors or warnings.
