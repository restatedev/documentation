Update deployment. Invokes the endpoint and replaces the existing deployment metadata with the discovered information. This is a dangerous operation that should be used only when there are failing invocations on the deployment that cannot be resolved any other way. Sense checks are applied to test that the new deployment is sufficiently similar to the old one.
