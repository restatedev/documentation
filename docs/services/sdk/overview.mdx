# Overview

Restate offers a Java SDK and a Typescript SDK.

## Installation

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

:::tip
To get started quickly, use the [template generator](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator)
:::


Add the `@restatedev/restate-sdk` dependency to your NodeJS project to start developing Restate services.

:::info
Restate currently supports two Typescript APIs for implementing services: the Handler API and the gRPC API.
The gRPC API requires you to specify the services, methods and data types via a Protobuf definition, as explained in the [service contract docs](/services/service_type#restate-service-contract).
The Handler API does not require this.

Add a set of the following dependencies.

Depending on the preferred language:
- To use Java: `dev.restate.sdk:sdk-java-blocking:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION`
- To use Kotlin: `dev.restate.sdk:sdk-kotlin:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION`

Depending on the deployment target:
- To run as long-running app: `dev.restate.sdk:sdk-http-vertx:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION`
- To run on AWS Lambda: `dev.restate.sdk:sdk-lambda:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION`

To use Jackson to read/write state entries: `dev.restate.sdk:sdk-serde-jackson:VAR::RESTATE_DIST_VERSION`

## API Examples

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript" default>

Below is an example of a Typescript service with the Handler API.

This example shows a greeter service comprising two methods:
- `greet`: returns a greeting as a response without performing any additional operations.
- `countGreetings`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name.

```typescript
const doGreet = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, name: string) => {
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
};

const doCountGreetings = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, name: string) => {
    // Retrieve state; number of times this name was seen
    let seen = await ctx.get<number>("seen") || 0;
    seen += 1;
    // Set the incremented counter as the new state
    ctx.set("seen", seen);

    return `Hello ${name} for the ${seen}th time!`
}

// Create the Restate server to accept requests
restate
    .createServer()
    .bindKeyedRouter("greeter", restate.keyedRouter({
        greet: sayHello, countGreetings: doCountGreetings
    }))
    .listen();
```

The app logic is implemented inside `doGreet` and `doCountGreetings`.
These functions have the `restate.RpcContext` as their first parameter. This context is used to interact with Restate (call other methods, retrieve state, etc.).
Then, the service is registered as a keyed service under the path `greeter`, and the `greet` and `countGreetings` routes are added.
The `greet` function can now be called by sending a request to `<restate-host>:8080/greeter/greet` or `<restate-host>:8080/greeter/countGreetings`.

For more information on how to set up the routers and the Restate server, have a look at the [serving docs](/services/sdk/serving).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="Typescript-gRPC">

Below is an example of a Typescript gRPC service.

The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API uses the `protobufjs` and `ts-proto` dependencies to work with the [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)-generated Typescript code. So add these as well to your `package.json`.

This example shows a greeter service comprising two methods:
- `greet`: returns a greeting as a response without performing any additional operations.
- `countGreetings`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name.

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";
import {
    Greeter,
    GreetRequest,
    GreetResponse,
    protoMetadata,
} from "./generated/proto/example";

// Implementation of the gRPC service
export class GreeterService implements Greeter {
    async greet(request: GreetRequest): Promise<GreetResponse> {
        return GreetResponse.create({ greeting: `Hello ${request.name}` });
    }

    async countGreetings(request: GreetRequest): Promise<GreetResponse> {
        // Retrieving the Restate context
        const ctx = restate.useContext(this);

        // Retrieve state; number of times this name was seen
        let seen = (await ctx.get<number>("seen")) || 0;
        seen += 1;
        // Set the incremented counter as the new state
        await ctx.set("seen", seen);

        return GreetResponse.create({
            greeting: `Hello ${request.name} for the ${seen}th time!`,
        });
    }
}

// Setting up the Restate server to serve the GreeterService methods.
// The server will listen on port 8000 for connections and requests.
restate
    .createServer()
    .bindService({
        descriptor: protoMetadata,
        service: "Greeter",
        instance: new GreeterService(),
    })
    .listen();
```

The interface of the gRPC service is defined in the [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) service contracts, that are shown below.
Within the method, the Restate context is retrieved, enabling interaction with Restate (e.g. getting stating, calling other services).
Finally, the Restate server is set up to serve both methods of the greeter service.

This is what corresponding Protobuf definition would look like for this service:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package example;

import "dev/restate/ext.proto";

service Greeter {
    option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

    rpc Greet(GreetRequest) returns (GreetResponse) {};

    rpc CountGreetings(GreetRequest) returns (GreetResponse) {};
}

message GreetRequest {
    string name = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];
}

message GreetResponse {
    string greeting = 1;
}
```

To understand the Restate-specific parts of this Protobuf definition, have a look at the documentation [here](/services/service_type#restate-service-contract).

Below is an example of a Java service. 

Restate uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) to define the service and its methods. The example shows a greeter service comprising two methods:
- `greet`: maintains a record of the number of times it has received a request for a given name, and prints a greeting.

```java
package dev.restate.sdk.examples;

import dev.restate.sdk.blocking.RestateBlockingService;
import dev.restate.sdk.blocking.RestateContext;
import dev.restate.sdk.core.StateKey;
import dev.restate.sdk.examples.generated.*;
import dev.restate.sdk.http.vertx.RestateHttpEndpointBuilder;
import io.grpc.stub.StreamObserver;
import static dev.restate.sdk.examples.generated.GreeterProto.*;

public class Greeter extends GreeterGrpc.GreeterImplBase implements RestateBlockingService {

  private static final StateKey<Integer> COUNT = StateKey.of("count", Integer.class);

  @Override
  public void greet(GreetRequest request, StreamObserver<GreetResponse> responseObserver) {
    RestateContext ctx = restateContext();

    int count = ctx.get(COUNT).orElse(1);
    ctx.set(COUNT, count + 1);

    responseObserver.onNext(GreetResponse.newBuilder()
                    .setMessage("Hello " + request.getName() + " for the " + count + " time!")
            .build());
    responseObserver.onCompleted();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    RestateHttpEndpointBuilder.builder().withService(new Greeter()).buildAndListen();
  }
}
```

The contract of the gRPC service is defined in the Protobuf service contracts, that are shown below.
Within the method, the Restate context is retrieved, enabling interaction with Restate (e.g. getting stating, calling other services).
Finally, the Restate server is set up to serve both methods of the greeter service.

This is what corresponding Protobuf definition would look like for this service:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package example;

import "dev/restate/ext.proto";

service Greeter {
    option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = UNKEYED;

    rpc Greet(GreetRequest) returns (GreetResponse) {};
}

message GreetRequest {
    string name = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];
}

message GreetResponse {
    string greeting = 1;
}
```

To understand the Restate-specific parts of this Protobuf definition, have a look at the documentation [here](/services/service_type#restate-service-contract).
