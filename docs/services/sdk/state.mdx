# State
Restate offers durable storage of application state, with support for key-value state that can be retrieved, set, and cleared via its key. Enabling this feature requires no additional setup.

## Retrieving state
To retrieve state in Restate, you can do the following:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript
const myValue: string | null = await ctx.get<string>("my-key");
```

Replace "my-key" with the key you want to retrieve. 
This will either return the value that was stored or it will return `null` if no value was stored. 

In this code snippet, the value stored is a string, but you can store any type that can be serialized as a 
buffer with `Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(yourObject))`. 

For example, to retrieve a number type, you could use the following code:

```typescript
const myValue = (await ctx.get<number>("my-key")) || 0;
```

This would retrieve the value of the `my-key` key. If the value is `null`, then it will return 0.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

First, you need to define the state key: a combination of a key name and (de)serializer:
For example, to store a `String`, `Long` or `Double`:
```java
// Store a String:
StateKey<String> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("my-key", TypeTag.STRING_UTF8);

// Store a Long:
StateKey<Long> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("my-key", Long.TYPE);

// Store a Double:
StateKey<Double> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("my-key", Double.TYPE);
```

For custom types, you can use Jackson serializers. For example, to store a list or a set:

```java
// Store a Set of String:
StateKey<Set<String>> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("my-key", JacksonSerde.typeRef(new TypeReference<>() {}));

// Store a List of Double:
StateKey<List<Double>> STATE_KEY = StateKey.of("my-key", JacksonSerde.typeRef(new TypeReference<>() {}));
```

Once you have defined the `STATE_KEY` at the top of your class, you can retrieve the state in your methods as follows:

```java
var state = ctx.get(STATE_KEY)
```

This will either return the value that was stored or it will return `null` if no value was stored. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Setting state
To set a K/V pair in Restate,
you can call the following method on the Restate context object from within your service method:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript
ctx.set("my-key", "my-new-value");
```

The value can be of any type that can be serialized as a Buffer.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
ctx.set(STATE_KEY, "my-new-value");
```

The value needs to line up with the type that was defined in the StateKey (see [Retrieving state](#retrieving-state)).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Replace `my-key` with the key that you are setting.
And replace `my-value` with the value that you want to set.


## Clearing state
To delete the value of a key in Restate,
you can call the following method on the Restate context object from within your service method:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript
ctx.clear("my-key");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
ctx.clear(STATE_KEY);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Replace `my-key` with the key that you are setting.
