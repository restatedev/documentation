# Serving
Restate services can run in two ways: as long-running services or as AWS Lambda functions.

## Restate server for long-running services

To register your service as a long-running service, do the following:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript" default>

**1. Define a router for your keyed or unkeyed service**

This router is used to link the function you implemented with an API path. 

For **unkeyed services**, the router looks as follows:

```typescript
const serviceRouter = restate.router({
    hello: async () => { ... },
    callMe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => { ... },
    maybe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, request: Request) => { ... }
});
```

This example shows a router for an unkeyed service with three functions and their respective API paths (`hello`, `callMe`, and `maybe`).
This means that the `hello` function can be called via `<restate-host>:8080/myServicePath/hello`.

The functions of an unkeyed router have two optional parameters:

- A `ctx` of type `restate.RpcContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
- A `request` of type JSON object that represents additional invocation data.

The parameter names may be chosen differently.

For **keyed services**, the router looks as follows:
```typescript
// 2. Create a router for keyed services (if any):
const keyedServiceRouter = restate.keyedRouter({
    hello: async () => { ... },
    callMe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext) => { ... },
    maybe: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, key: string) => { ... },
    withSomething: async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, key: string, request: Request) => { ... }
});
```

This example shows a router for a keyed service with four functions and their respective API paths (`hello`, `callMe`, `maybe`, and `withSomething`).
This means that the `hello` function can be called via `<restate-host>:8080/myServicePath/hello`.

The functions of a keyed router have three optional parameters:

- A `ctx` of type `restate.RpcContext` which allows to interact with Restate.
- A `key` parameter of type string which represents the key of the invoked service.
- A `request` parameter of type JSON object which represents additional invocation data.

The parameter names may be chosen differently.

**2. Export the service API**

You use the exported serviceApi to call this service from within other services (see [service communication docs](/services/sdk/service-communication))

```typescript
export const myServiceApi: restate.ServiceApi<typeof serviceRouter> = {
    path: "myServicePath",
};

// use the same syntax for keyed services:
export const myKeyedServiceApi: restate.ServiceApi<typeof keyedServiceRouter> = {
    path: "myServicePath",
};
```
This means that the `hello` function of this service can be called via `<restate-host>:8080/myServicePath/hello`.

**3. Create the server**

Create the server. Then, bind the services with `bindRouter` for unkeyed services and `bindKeyedRouter` for keyed services.
You need to supply the service path and router. 
Finally, let the server listen on a specified port (default is `9080`):

```typescript
restate
  .createServer()
  // bind the keyed services to the Restate server
  .bindRouter(myServiceApi.path, serviceRouter)
  // bind the unkeyed services to the Restate server
  .bindKeyedRouter(myKeyedServiceApi.path, keyedServiceRouter)
  .listen();
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="Typescript-gRPC">

```typescript
restate
  .createServer()
  .bindService({
    descriptor: protoMetadata,
    service: "Greeter",
    instance: new GreeterService(),
  })
  .listen();
```

First, call the `createServer()` method to create a new `RestateServer`.

Then, bind one or multiple services to the server.
- As `descriptor`, you need to provide the `protoMetadata` that was generated by the Protobuf code generator. 
- The value assigned to `service` should correspond to the name of the service defined in the Protobuf service definition. This code example assumes the service is called `Greeter`. This means that the Protobuf definition includes the following:
```protobuf
service Greeter {
  // Definition of the methods
  //...
}
```
- For the `instance` field, provide an instance of the service implementation. 

Finally, call `listen(port?)` to have the RestateServer listen on the specified port for connections and requests.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
RestateHttpEndpointBuilder.builder().withService(new Greeter()).buildAndListen();
```

First, create a `RestateHttpEndpointBuilder`, then bind one or multiple services to the server.

Finally, call `buildAndListen(port)` to have the RestateServer listen on the specified port for connections and requests.

## Restate Lambda handler

To register your service as a Lambda function,
only minimal changes are required, as compared to the long-running service:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript" default>

```typescript
export const handler = restate
    //highlight-next-line
  .createLambdaApiGatewayHandler()
  .bindRouter(myServiceApi.path, serviceRouter)
  .bindKeyedRouter(myKeyedServiceApi.path, keyedServiceRouter)
    //highlight-next-line
  .handle();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="Typescript-gRPC">

```typescript
export const handler = restate
    //highlight-next-line
    .createLambdaApiGatewayHandler()
    .bindService({
        descriptor: protoMetadata,
        service: "Greeter",
        instance: new GreeterService(),
    })
    //highlight-next-line
    .handle();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
import dev.restate.sdk.lambda.LambdaRestateServer;
import dev.restate.sdk.lambda.LambdaRestateServerFactory;

public class LambdaFactory implements LambdaRestateServerFactory {
  @Override
  public LambdaRestateServer create() {
    return LambdaRestateServer.builder().withService(new GreeterService()).build();
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Implement a `LambdaRestateServerFactory` with a `create` method that returns a `LambdaRestateServer` with the services binded to it.

:::info 
That's all you need to do to enable running on AWS Lambda.
The implementation of your service methods remains the same for both deployment options.

for guidance on how to deploy your services on AWS Lambda.
