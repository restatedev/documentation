# Kafka

Restate can consume events directly from Kafka. To do that, you need to:

* Develop an event handler, to consume events within your Restate service
* Deploy Restate with the configuration to connect to a Kafka cluster
* Wire up an event handler with a Kafka topic through a subscription

:::caution
Kafka support is in development, and it isn't ready for production usage. Next releases might break the current API.
:::

## Event handler

Depending on your use case you can build different types of event handlers. We distinguish between the following scenarios:

* Handle events with a string key from Kafka in Restate services keyed with a `string` key.
* Process generic events from Kafka in order (currently only supported by the TypeScript gRPC API and the Java API.)

An event handlers can profit from the same features as other Restate handlers, including durable execution, [service communication](/services/sdk/service-communication) and [side effects](/services/sdk/side-effects).

** Handling events with string key **

You can handle events within keyed routers, where the key of the Kafka record matches the key used by the router:

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const router = restate.keyedRouter({
    eventHandler: restate.keyedEventHandler(async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, event: restate.Event) => {
        // Extract event payload as json
        const { myData } = event.json<{ myData: string }>();
        // OR extract event payload as raw bytes and deserialize it
        // using the format of your choice (e.g. Avro, Protobuf, ...)
        const bodyBuffer = event.body();

        // --- Business logic),
        // Other rpc or event handlers
    };
});

restate
    .endpoint()
    .bindKeyedRouter("myRouter", router)
    .listen();
```

The Kafka record key must be a valid UTF-8 string, otherwise Restate won't be able to deliver the event to the service.

You can mix event handlers with other event handlers or RPC handlers. For example, assume you're implementing a `profile` router to handle and store user profiles in Restate, where the key is the profile's unique identifier.
In the same service, you can implement an RPC method called `get` to retrieve the profile, and you can attach an event handler called `updateProfile` to consume events from Kafka to update the profile.

For each event key (= Kafka record key), the events are delivered in the order in which they arrived on the topic partition.

** Handling keyed events within keyed services**

You can handle events within keyed services, where the key of the Kafka record matches the key used by the service.

To do so, define the event handler as any other method and use the `EVENT_PAYLOAD` annotation to receive the event payload:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
import "dev/restate/ext.proto";

service MyService {
    option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

    // A method of this service
    rpc MyMethod(MyMethodRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

    // Event handler method
    rpc HandleEvent(MyEvent) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
}

message MyMethodRequest {
    string id = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];
    // ... Other fields
}

message MyEvent {
    string id = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];

    bytes payload = 2 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = EVENT_PAYLOAD];

    // This is optional
    map<string, string> metadata = 3 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = EVENT_METADATA];
}
```

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

import { MyService, MyEvent } from "./generated/my_service";
import Empty from "./generated/google/protobuf/empty";

export class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    async handleEvent(request: MyEvent): Promise<Empty> {
      const ctx = restate.useContext(this);
      const payload = request.payload;

      // Handle event

      return Empty.create({});
    }

    // ... Other service methods
}
```

:::tip Combining RPC and Kafka within a service
You can mix methods receiving events with regular RPC methods. For example, assume you're implementing a `Profile` service to handle and store user profiles in Restate, where the key is the profile's unique identifier.
In the same service, you can implement an RPC  `Get` method to retrieve the profile, and you can attach an `UpdateProfile` event handler to consume events from Kafka to update the profile.
:::

For each event key (= Kafka record key), the events are delivered in the order in which they arrived on the topic partition.

There are some constraints for the annotated fields:

* The event handler's key input type must be `string`.
* The Kafka record key must contain a valid UTF-8 string, otherwise Restate won't be able to deliver the event to the service.
* You can use only `string` or `bytes` types with fields annotated as `EVENT_PAYLOAD`.
* You can also get the event metadata defining a field as `map<string, string>` and annotating it with `EVENT_METADATA`.

** Handling generic events from Kafka **

You can handle generic events from Kafka by defining ad-hoc services that process `dev.restate.Event`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
import "dev/restate/ext.proto";
import "dev/restate/events.proto";

service MyService {
    option (dev.restate.ext.service_type) = KEYED;

    rpc Handle(dev.restate.Event) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
}
```

If the service is keyed, events with the same key are delivered in the order in which they arrived on the topic partition.
If the service is unkeyed, events will be delivered in parallel without ordering guarantees.

Event handlers can be useful when you need to pre-process an event before sending it to one or more Restate services, such as when the key is serialized using a custom format, or when the destination of the event is encoded in the payload.

    string id = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];
    // ... Other fields
}

message MyEvent {
    string id = 1 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = KEY];

    // This is optional
    map<string, string> metadata = 3 [(dev.restate.ext.field) = EVENT_METADATA];
}
```

```java
import dev.restate.generated.MyEvent;

@Override
public void handle(RestateContext ctx, MyEvent event) {

    // Do something with event
}
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: vanilla gRPC</summary>

```java
import dev.restate.generated.MyEvent;

@Override
public void handle(MyEvent event, StreamObserver<Empty> responseObserver) {

    // Do something with event

    responseObserver.onNext(Empty.getDefaultInstance());
    responseObserver.onCompleted();
}
```

## Event metadata

Each event carries a `metadata` map that contains the following entries:

* `restate.subscription.id`: The subscription identifier, as shown by the [Admin API](../../references/admin-api).
* `kafka.offset`: The record offset.
* `kafka.partition`: The record partition.
* `kafka.timestamp`: The record timestamp.

## Configure Kafka clusters when deploying Restate

To connect to a Kafka topic, you must configure the Kafka cluster to connect to.

You can define Kafka clusters in the [Restate configuration file](/restate/configuration#configuration-file):

```yaml
worker:
  kafka:
    clusters:
      my-cluster: # Cluster name
        bootstrap.servers: localhost:9092
        # You can add here any config param from
        # https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md
```

Check the [configuration documentation](/restate/configuration) for more details.

:::caution 
Configuring the Kafka clusters through [environment variables](/restate/configuration#overriding-configuration-entries-with-environment-variables) is not supported.
:::

## Connect an event handler with a topic

To connect event handlers to a Kafka topic, you need to create a subscription using the [Admin API](/references/admin-api):

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"source": "kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>", "sink": "service://<SERVICE_NAME>/<METHOD_NAME>"}'
```

For example:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"source": "kafka://my-cluster/my-topic", "sink": "service://myRouter/eventHandler"}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="TypeScript-gRPC">

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"source": "kafka://my-cluster/my-topic", "sink": "service://MyService/Handle"}'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"source": "kafka://my-cluster/my-topic", "sink": "service://MyService/Handle"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you've created a subscription, Restate immediately starts consuming events from Kafka.

### Additional subscription configuration

You can add additional configuration parameters to the subscription through the `options` field, for example to start consuming the topic from the beginning:

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"source": "kafka://<CLUSTER_NAME>/<TOPIC_NAME>", "sink": "service://<SERVICE_NAME>/<METHOD_NAME>", "options": {"auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}}'
```

The `options` field accepts any configuration parameter from [librdkafka configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md).

### Listing subscriptions

List the current subscriptions via:

```shell
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions
```

For example:

```shell
curl localhost:9070/subscriptions
```

### Deleting a subscription

The creation and listing of subscriptions returns an identifier. You can use this identifier to delete a subscription:

```shell
curl -X DELETE <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_IDENTIFIER>
```

For example:

```shell
curl -X DELETE localhost:9070/subscriptions/018cd978aa9f77b5a80454bc060c2a77
```

When you delete a subscription, Restate stops the consumer group associated to it.

:::info
Due to the current implementation, once you delete the subscription, there might still be messages enqueued in Restate to be processed by the subscriber service. This behaviour might change in next releases.
