# Restate context

In Restate services, all interaction with the runtime occur through the Restate context.
This context provides a set of methods that allow you to perform actions such as getting or setting state, or
calling other services.

You can retrieve the context object as follows:

<Tabs groupId="ts-api">
<TabItem value="handler" label="Handler API">

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const greet = async (ctx: restate.RpcContext, name: string) => {
    // The Restate context is supplied as an argument `ctx`

    //...the rest of your code...
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="grpc" label="gRPC API">


```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

async greet(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const restateContext = restate.useContext(this);

  //...the rest of your code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



:::info
The code blocks in the Typescript documentation refer to the Restate Context via the variable named `restateContext`.
:::

:::caution 
All method calls made through the Restate context are durably stored in the execution log
and can be replayed in case of failure, ensuring that your service is always reliable and fault-tolerant.
This means that if you do actions (e.g. calling other services, sleep) without making use of the Restate SDK,
you do not have these benefits.
