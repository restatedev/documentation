# Service communication
A Restate service can call another service without waiting for the response (one-way call) or with waiting for the response (request-response).

## Request-response calls
Request-response calls are requests where the client waits for the response.

Let's assume we have a `Greeter` service running next to the service we are currently developing.
This `Greeter` service has a method called `Greet` that takes an input request containing a `name` as a `string`.
To make request-response calls to the `Greeter` service, do the following:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

On the side of the service that you are going to call, you export the API definition, as follows (for more details look at the [serving docs](/services/sdk/serving)): 

```ts
const greeterRouter = restate.router({
  greet:    async(ctx: restate.RpcContext, name: string) => { ... }
});

// Option 1: export only the type signature of the router
export type myGreeterApiType = typeof greeterRouter;

// Option 2: export the API definition with type and name (path)
export const myGreeterApi: restate.ServiceApi<typeof greeterRouter> = { path : "greeter" };

restate.createServer().bindRouter("greeter", greeterRouter).listen(8080);
```

On the client side (service which is doing the call), you use the exported API definition to do the RPC.
For example, call the `greet` function of the `greeter` service for the name `Pete` via:

```ts
// Option 1: use only types and supply service name separately. 
const result1 = await ctx.rpc<myGreeterApiType>({path: "greeter"}).greet("Restate");

// Option 2: use full API spec
const result2 = await ctx.rpc(myGreeterApi).greet("Restate");
```

To do request-response calls, use the gRPC client implementation supplied via the generated Protobuf code.
In this example, the `Greet` function requires a `Request` Protobuf message as input with a single `name` parameter.

```typescript
const client = new GreeterClientImpl(ctx);
const greeting = await client.greet(
    GreetRequest.create({ name: "Restate" })
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

Use Restate's generated clients to do the call.
For example, if you have a `Greeter` service with a method `greet`:

```java
GreeterRestate.GreeterRestateClient client = GreeterRestate.newClient(ctx);
var req = GreetRequest.newBuilder().setName("Restate").build();
GreetResponse response = client.greet(req).await();
```

You can do request-response calls via `ctx.call` by supplying it with the gRPC method descriptor and request, by using the generated Protobuf code.
In this example, the `Greet` function requires a `Request` Protobuf message as input with a single `name` parameter.

```java
var req = GreetRequest.newBuilder().setName("Pete").build();
GreetResponse response = ctx.call(
    GreeterGrpc.getGreetMethod(),
    req
).await();
```

The Restate SDK sends these requests to Restate, that logs them in the Restate journal.
And in case of failures, Restate takes care of retries.


## One-way calls
A one-way call is a call from one service to another service where the client does not wait for a response, sometimes also called fire-and-forget.
Without Restate, this is usually implemented by adding a message queue in between the two services. 
Restate eliminates the need for a message queue because Restate durably logs the request and makes sure it gets executed.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

On the side of the service that you are going to call, you export the API definition as shown in the [request-response calls section](/services/sdk/service-communication#request-response-calls).

On the client side (service which is doing the call), you use the exported API definition to do the one-way call. For example, call the `greet` function of the `greeter` service for the name `Pete` via:

```ts
// option 1: use only types and supply service name separately
ctx.send<myGreeterApiType>({path: "greeter"}).greet("Pete");

// option 2: use full API spec
ctx.send(myGreeterApi).greet("Pete");
```

<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="TypeScript-gRPC">

Use the gRPC client implementation supplied via the generated Protobuf code to do the call, but wrap the call with `ctx.oneWayCall` as shown below:

```typescript
const client = new GreeterClientImpl(ctx);
await ctx.oneWayCall(() =>
    client.greet(Request.create({ name: "Pete" }))
);
```

You need to await the Promise that is returned from `oneWayCall()`, otherwise a failure in sending the message does not get propagated back to your user code.
Note that the Promise gets resolved as soon as the message gets send to the runtime, so awaiting the promise does not mean it is a request-response call.

:::caution
You can only use `oneWayCall()` to do one-way calls to other services via the proto-ts clients that are generated.
You cannot wrap any other types of operations with `oneWayCall()`! This is invalid code and will fail.

Use Restate's generated clients to do the call.
For example, if you have a `Greeter` service with a method `greet`:

```java
GreeterRestate.GreeterRestateClient client = GreeterRestate.newClient(ctx);
var req = GreetingRequest.newBuilder().setName("Pete").build();
client.oneWay().greet(req);

  GreeterGrpc.getGreetMethod(),
  req
);

## Delayed calls
A delayed call is a one-way call that gets executed after a specified delay.


<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

On the side of the service that you are going to call, you export the API definition as shown in the [request-response calls section](/services/sdk/service-communication#request-response-calls).

On the client side (service which is doing the call), you use the exported API definition to do the delayed one-way call. For example, call the `greet` function of the `greeter` service for the name `Pete` with a delay of 5 seconds  via:

```ts
// option 1: use only types and supply service name separately
ctx.sendDelayed<myGreeterApiType>({path: "greeter"}, 5000).greet("Pete");

// option 2: use full API spec
ctx.sendDelayed(myGreeterApi, 5000).greet("Pete");
```

<TabItem value="ts-grpc" label="TypeScript-gRPC">

```typescript
const client = new GreeterClientImpl(ctx);
await ctx.delayedCall(() =>

client.delayed(Duration.ofSeconds(1)).greet(req);

Restate takes care of the scheduling and the durability of the delayed call.
