# Determinism & side effects

:::danger
Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
For this to work, the user code needs to be deterministic.
:::

For random generators (UUIDs, random numbers) there are built-in helper functions, as [listed below](/services/sdk/side-effects#built-in-helper-functions).
For all other non-deterministic code, you need to use side effects.

## Side effects
Side effects help relaxing the constraints on determinism.
If your code does something that is non-deterministic, then you have to wrap it in a side effect.
By doing this, Restate makes sure that the result is persistently stored in the execution log
and that the value is retained during replays.

Here is an example of a database request for which the string return value is stored as a side effect in Restate:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const result = await ctx.sideEffect<string>(async () => doDbRequest());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
var result = ctx.sideEffect(CoreSerdes.STRING_UTF8, () -> doDbRequest());
```

You need to define the return value type of the side effect, so that the Restate SDK knows how to serialize and deserialize it.
For the primitive types, you can use Restate's built-in `dev.restate.sdk.core.CoreSerdes`, for example `CoreSerdes.STRING_UTF8` or `CoreSerdes.BOOLEAN`.
For more information, have a look at the documentation on [serialization](/services/sdk/serialization).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once stored, the request to the database will not get re-executed upon replay, but the first result will be used instead.

:::caution
You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a side effect!
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting side effects.
:::



### Retrying on failure

If the side effect closure throws an error, then it is retried infinitely using an exponential backoff strategy until it succeeds.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const paymentAction = async () => {
    const result = await paymentClient.call(txId, amount);
    if (result.error) {
    //highlight-next-line
        throw result.error;
    } else {
        return result.isSuccess;
    }
}
const success: boolean = await ctx.sideEffect(paymentAction);
```

** Manually controlling the retry policy **

Instead of using an infinite exponential backoff strategy, you can also specify a finite retry policy when executing a side effect.
A finite retry policy retries a failing side effect function until all retry attempts are depleted.
If this happens, then the side effect fails terminally with a `restate.TerminalError` which is propagated to the user code.
In order to configure the retry policy you need to provide a `RetrySettings` object:

```typescript
//highlight-next-line
const retrySettings = { initialDelayMs: 1000, maxDelayMs: 60000, maxRetries: 10 }
const paymentAction = async () => {
    const result = await paymentClient.call(txId, amount);
    if (result.error) {
        throw result.error;
    } else {
        return result.isSuccess;
    }
}

try {
  await ctx.sideEffect(
    paymentAction,
    //highlight-next-line
    retrySettings
  );
} catch (error) {
  // handle terminal error
}
```

The `RetrySettings` object has the following fields:
- `initialDelayMs` (number): The initial delay between retries. As more retries happen, the delay may change per the policy.
- `maxDelayMs` (number): Optionally, the maximum delay between retries. No matter what the policy says, this is the maximum time
  that Restate sleeps between retries. If not set, there is effectively no limit (internally the limit is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
- `maxRetries` (number): The maximum number of retries before this function fails with an exception. If not set, there is effectively no limit (internally the limit is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
- `policy`:  Optionally, the retry policy to use (`FIXED_DELAY` or `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`). Defaults to `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`.
- `name` (string): Optionally, the name of side effect action that is used in error and log messages around retries.

For example:
```typescript
const retrySettings = {
    initialDelayMs: 1000,
    maxDelayMs: 60000,
    maxRetries: 10,
    policy: EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF,
    name: "my-side-effect"
}
```

  if(result){
    // highlight-next-line
    throw new IllegalStateException("Payment failed");
  } else {
    return result;
  }
});
```

### Terminal failures of side effects

By default, a side effect function is retried infinitely on failure.
If you want to let the side effect fail terminally, then you have to throw a terminal error.
A terminal error will stop the infinite retry strategy and lets the SDK propagate the error to the user code where it can be handled.
The terminal error will also be recorded in the journal so that it will be deterministically thrown on replay.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

You can throw a terminal error by using `restate.TerminalError`:

```typescript
const paymentAction = async () => {
    const result = await paymentClient.call(txId, amount);
    if (result.error) {
        //highlight-next-line
        throw new restate.TerminalError(result.error);
    } else {
        return result.isSuccess;
    }
}

try {
  await ctx.sideEffect(paymentAction);
} catch (error) {
  // handle terminal error
}
```



</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

You can throw a terminal exception via `dev.restate.sdk.core.TerminalException` and supply it with a `dev.restate.sdk.core.TerminalException.Code` and a message:

```java
  private boolean payment() {
    boolean result = paymentClient.call(txid, amount);
    if(result){
      //highlight-next-line
      throw new TerminalException(Code.UNKNOWN, "Payment failed");
    } else {
      return result;
    }
  };

  @Override
  public void myMethod(Request request, StreamObserver<Empty> responseObserver) {
    RestateContext ctx = restateContext();

    //highlight-start
    try {
      ctx.sideEffect(CoreSerdes.BOOLEAN, this::payment);
    } catch (TerminalException e) {
      // handle terminal error
    }
    //highlight-end

    responseObserver.onNext(Empty.getDefaultInstance());
    responseObserver.onCompleted();
  }
```

## Built-in helper functions
Two common non-deterministic actions are the generation of UUIDs and random numbers.
The SDK provides helper functions for those.

### Generating UUIDs

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const uuid = ctx.rand.uuidv4();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
UUID uuid = ctx.random().nextUUID();
```

:::note
`ctx.random()` returns a `RestateRandom` instance. This is a subclass of `java.util.Random` that seeds it on the invocation ID, to always return the same value on retries.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger
Do not use this in cryptographic contexts.
:::

:::tip
You can use this to generate stable idempotency keys with one line of code.
For example, imagine a payment service where you want to avoid having duplicate payments during retries.
You could use this utility to generate a UUID and then use that UUID as identifier of the payment.
You only allow the payment to go through if no payment with that UUID was done yet.
Restate guarantees that once the UUID is stored, it is retained during retries.
:::

### Generating random numbers

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const randomNumber = ctx.rand.random();
```

Calls to `ctx.rand.random()` return a new pseudorandom float within the range [0,1].

:::note
This is the equivalent of JS `Math.random()` but deterministic, because it gets seeded by the invocation ID of the current invocation.
Since retries use the same invocation ID, they will get the same random number.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
int value = ctx.random().nextInt();
```

You can use any of the methods of [`java.util.Random`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) to generate random numbers: for example, `nextBoolean()`, `nextLong()`, `nextFloat()`, etc.

:::note
`ctx.random()` returns a `RestateRandom` instance. This is a subclass of `java.util.Random` that seeds it on the invocation ID, to always return the same value on retries.
