# Side effects

:::danger
Restate uses an execution log for replay after failures and suspensions.
For this to work, the user code needs to be deterministic.
:::

Side effects help relaxing the constraints on determinism.
If your code does something that is not deterministic then you have to wrap it in a side effect.
By doing this, Restate makes sure that the result is persistently stored in the execution log
and that the value is retained during replays.

Here is an example in which a unique ID is generated and stored in Restate:

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const uuid = await ctx.sideEffect(async () => uuid());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
var uuid = ctx.sideEffect(CoreSerdes.STRING_UTF8, () -> UUID.randomUUID().toString());
```

You need to define the return value type of the side effect, so that the Restate SDK knows how to serialize and deserialize it.
For the primitive types, you can use Restate's built-in `dev.restate.sdk.core.CoreSerdes`, for example `CoreSerdes.STRING_UTF8` or `CoreSerdes.BOOLEAN`.
For more information, have a look at the documentation on [serialization](/services/sdk/serialization).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once stored, every retry of the example code snippet will get the same UUID.
For example, imagine a payment service where you want to avoid having duplicate payments during retries.
You could use a side effect to generate and store a UUID and then use that UUID as identifier of the payment.
You only allow the payment to go through if no payment with that UUID was done yet.
Restate guarantees that once the UUID is stored, it is retained during retries.

:::caution
You cannot invoke any methods on the Restate context within a side effect!
This includes actions such as getting state, calling another service, and nesting side effects.

## Retrying on failure

If the side effect closure throws an error, then it is retried infinitely using an exponential backoff strategy until it succeeds.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const paymentAction = async () => {
    const result = await paymentClient.call(txId, amount);
    if (result.error) {
    //highlight-next-line
        throw result.error;
    } else {
        return result.isSuccess;
    }
}
const success: boolean = await ctx.sideEffect(paymentAction);
```

** Manually controlling the retry policy **

Instead of using an infinite exponential backoff strategy, you can also specify a finite retry policy when executing a side effect.
A finite retry policy retries a failing side effect function until all retry attempts are depleted.
If this happens, then the side effect fails terminally with a `restate.TerminalError` which is propagated to the user code.
In order to configure the retry policy you need to provide a `RetrySettings` object:

```typescript
//highlight-next-line
const retrySettings = { initialDelayMs: 1000, maxDelayMs: 60000, maxRetries: 10 }
const paymentAction = async () => {
    const result = await paymentClient.call(txId, amount);
    if (result.error) {
        throw result.error;
    } else {
        return result.isSuccess;
    }
}

try {
  await ctx.sideEffect(
    paymentAction,
    //highlight-next-line
    retrySettings
  );
} catch (error) {
  // handle terminal error
}
```

The `RetrySettings` object has the following fields:
- `initialDelayMs` (number): The initial delay between retries. As more retries happen, the delay may change per the policy.
- `maxDelayMs` (number): Optionally, the maximum delay between retries. No matter what the policy says, this is the maximum time
  that Restate sleeps between retries. If not set, there is effectively no limit (internally the limit is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
- `maxRetries` (number): The maximum number of retries before this function fails with an exception. If not set, there is effectively no limit (internally the limit is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
- `policy`:  Optionally, the retry policy to use (`FIXED_DELAY` or `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`). Defaults to `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`.
- `name` (string): Optionally, the name of side effect action that is used in error and log messages around retries.

For example:
```typescript
const retrySettings = {
    initialDelayMs: 1000,
    maxDelayMs: 60000,
    maxRetries: 10,
    policy: EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF,
    name: "my-side-effect"
}
```

    throw new IllegalStateException("Payment failed");
  } else {
    return result;
  }
});
```

## Terminal failures of side effects

By default, a side effect function is retried infinitely on failure.
If you want to let the side effect fail terminally, then you have to throw a terminal error.
A terminal error will stop the infinite retry strategy and lets the SDK propagate the error to the user code where it can be handled.
The terminal error will also be recorded in the journal so that it will be deterministically thrown on replay.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

You can throw a terminal error by using `restate.TerminalError`:

```typescript
const paymentAction = async () => {
    const result = await paymentClient.call(txId, amount);
    if (result.error) {
        //highlight-next-line
        throw new restate.TerminalError(result.error);
    } else {
        return result.isSuccess;
    }
}

try {
  await ctx.sideEffect(paymentAction);
} catch (error) {
  // handle terminal error
}
```



</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

You can throw a terminal exception via `dev.restate.sdk.core.TerminalException` and supply it with a `dev.restate.sdk.core.TerminalException.Code` and a message:

```java
  private boolean payment() {
    boolean result = paymentClient.call(txid, amount);
    if(result){
      //highlight-next-line
      throw new TerminalException(Code.UNKNOWN, "Payment failed");
    } else {
      return result;
    }
  };

  @Override
  public void myMethod(Request request, StreamObserver<Empty> responseObserver) {
    RestateContext ctx = restateContext();

    //highlight-start
    try {
      ctx.sideEffect(CoreSerdes.BOOLEAN, this::payment);
    } catch (TerminalException e) {
      // handle terminal error
    }
    //highlight-end

    responseObserver.onNext(Empty.getDefaultInstance());
    responseObserver.onCompleted();
  }
```
