# AWS Lambda with CDK

## Deploying Restate services as AWS Lambda functions

You can deploy your Restate service handlers as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) Functions.
The [Restate CDK support library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@restatedev/restate-cdk) provides convenient constructs
for managing Restate service deployments on AWS Lambda.

The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) provides an elegant way to define your cloud
application infrastructure in a familiar programming language. Currently, we support CDK projects built in TypeScript,
but you can deploy Restate handlers in any language supported by a Restate SDK. CDK is often used to manage serverless
application stacks, and the Restate CDK constructs are the easiest method to deploy and manage Restate services on AWS
Lambda.

If you don't have an existing CDK project, follow the CDK [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html)
page to set one up.

### Adding the Restate CDK support library

Add the Restate CDK support library to your project:

```shell
npm install @restatedev/restate-cdk
```

### Deploy your handler code to AWS Lambda

Define one or more Lambda functions in your CDK stack to model the service handlers in your chosen language. Depending
on the SDK and programming language, you may need an additional build process such as Gradle, to bundle your business
logic in a Lambda-deployable artifact. To deploy Restate services we use the standard CDK Lambda constructs.

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default>

For TypeScript/JavaScript services, you can use the [`NodejsFunction`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs-readme.html)
construct to transpile and bundle all the required dependencies.

```typescript
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
import { NodejsFunction } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs";

const service = new NodejsFunction(scope, "RestateService", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
  architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
  entry: "handler", // use the path to your service handler
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm" label="Java" default>

For Java/Kotlin services, you can use the regular function construct with a supported JVM runtime. This example assumes
that some build process has already produced a "fat JAR" artifact containing all the required dependencies. For an
example of how to do this in Gradle, refer to the [hello-world-lambda-cdk](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/blob/main/kotlin/hello-world-lambda-cdk/lambda/build.gradle.kts)
project.

```typescript
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";

const service: lambda.Function = new lambda.Function(scope, "RestateService", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.JAVA_21,
  architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(".../lambda-all.jar"), // path to the "fat JAR" artifact
  handler: "com.example.service.package.LambdaHandler", // fully qualified handler class name
  timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10), // the default timeout of 3s may not be enough for initialization!
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deploy a self-hosted Restate server 

Restate is [very easy to deploy](/restate/deployment), and we provide a CDK construct to make it super simple to deploy
a self-hosted development server on Amazon EC2.
See [Deploying Restate on Amazon EC2 with CDK](/restate/deployment#amazon-ec2-with-cdk) for more information on using
the `SingleNodeRestateInstance` construct.

### Register Lambda-based services with Restate

To enable our Lambda handlers to receive Restate requests, we need to create a deployment with Restate.
The `LambdaServiceRegistry` construct represents a collection of Lambda-backed Restate services and takes
care of creating/updating Restate Deployments backed by the specified Lambda functions any time you deploy a change
to your stack. Restate uses Lambda versioning to consistently target the same function configuration from a given
deployment revision.

<TabItem value="cloud" label="Restate Cloud" default>

When using Restate Cloud managed service, you model it with the `RestateCloudEndpoint` construct. As well as holding
the specific configuration properties, this construct creates an IAM role that can be assumed by the Restate Managed
Service AWS account, with permission to invoke any version of all the listed service handlers Lambda functions.

:::caution
The `RestateCloudEndpoint` construct creates an IAM role that can be assumed by the Restate Managed Service AWS account!
:::

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-cdk";

const restateService = new restate.RestateCloudEndpoint(scope, "RestateCloud", {
  clusterId: "restate-cluster-id",
  authTokenSecretArn: restateAuthToken.secretFullArn,
});

const handlers = new restate.LambdaServiceRegistry(scope, "RestateServiceRegistry", {
  serviceHandlers: {
    "namespace.Service": service,
    // additional handlers as needed
  },
  restate: restateService,
});
handlers.register({
  metaEndpoint: restateService.metaEndpoint,
  invokerRoleArn: restateService.invokerRole.roleArn,
  authTokenSecretArn: restateService.authToken.secretArn,
});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-hosted" default>

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-cdk";

// const restateService: restate.SingleNodeRestateInstance = ...;

const handlers = new restate.LambdaServiceRegistry(scope, "RestateServiceRegistry", {
  serviceHandlers: {
    "namespace.Service": service,
    // additional handlers as needed
  },
  restate: restateService,
});
handlers.register({
  metaEndpoint: restateService.metaEndpoint,
  invokerRoleArn: restateService.invokerRole.roleArn,
  authTokenSecretArn: restateService.authToken.secretArn,
});
```

## Complete examples

You can use the following examples as references for your own CDK projects:

- [hello-world-lambda-cdk](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/kotlin/hello-world-lambda-cdk) - provides a
  simple example of a Lambda-deployed Kotlin handler
- [Restate Holiday](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-holiday) - a more complex example of a fictional reservation
  service demonstrating the Saga orchestration pattern
