# General

Restate services are deployed within *Service deployments*. The Restate runtime interacts with service deployments by sending requests to them using a custom protocol on top of HTTP.

A service deployment can be a Lambda function, a Kubernetes pod, a Knative Service, or any other process reachable at a specific URL.

The URL (including path prefix) MUST be **unique**, meaning that no two deployments with the same URL can exist at the same time in a Restate instance.

Moreover, service deployments are **immutable**, and are assumed to be reachable throughout the entire lifecycle of an invocation. To deploy any change to a service, either in the Protobuf definition or in the business logic, you should deploy a new deployment with a new URL. See the [versioning documentation](/services/upgrades-removal) for more details on how to update services.
