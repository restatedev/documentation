# Registration

After deploying a service deployment, in order to use it, it must be registered with Restate as follows:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate deployments register <SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI>
```

Or you can use the shorthand:

```shell
restate dp add <SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "<SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI>"}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



When registering a service deployment, Restate uses a mechanism similar to "reflections" to discover the available services and their schemas and properties. A service can be registered only once, and subsequent registration requests to the same deployment will fail. For more details on how to update services, check the [versioning documentation](/services/upgrades-removal).

The deployment creation can be forced to overwrite an existing deployment:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate dp add --force <SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl <RESTATE_ADMIN_URL>/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "<SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI>", "force": true}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


This will forcefully overwrite the existing service deployment with the same uri, forcing the discovery process again. It will also remove services that were served by that deployment and are not available anymore.

:::warning
Forcing a deployment registration is a feature designed to simplify local Restate service development, and should never be used in a production Restate deployment, as it potentially breaks all the in-flight invocations to that deployment.
