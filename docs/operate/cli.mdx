# CLI

You can use the CLI to interact with Restate, and manage your services, deployments and invocations.

## Installation

### Option 1: Using a package manager
Install the Restate CLI via:

<CH.Code>

```shell npm
npm install --global @restatedev/restate
```

```shell Homebrew
brew install restatedev/tap/restate
```

</CH.Code>

### Option 2: Download the binary
Use `curl` to download the binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/latest), and make them executable:

<CH.Code rows={"5"}>

```shell MacOS-x64
curl -LO https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/latest/download/restate.x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf restate.x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz && \
chmod +x restate && \
sudo mv restate /usr/local/bin/
```

```shell MacOS-arm64
curl -LO https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/latest/download/restate.aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf restate.aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz && \
chmod +x restate && \
sudo mv restate /usr/local/bin/
```

```shell Linux-x64
curl -LO https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/latest/download/restate.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf restate.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz && \
chmod +x restate && \
sudo mv restate /usr/local/bin/
```

```shell Linux-arm64
curl -LO https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/latest/download/restate.aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf restate.aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz && \
chmod +x restate && \
sudo mv restate /usr/local/bin/
```

</CH.Code>

Check if the CLI is configured correctly:

```shell
restate whoami
```

Print help to see all available commands:

```shell
restate --help
```

## Configuration

There are two ways to configure the CLI: via environment variables or via a configuration file.

### Using environment variables

You can specify the following environment variables:

- `RESTATE_HOST`: The hostname/IP address of the server. Default is `localhost`.
- `RESTATE_HOST_SCHEME`: Default is `http`.
- `RESTATE_ADMIN_URL`: To specify the full URL of the admin server (scheme+host+port).
- `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN`: Set if authentication is required.

For example, to specify the hostname `myhost` and the host scheme `https`, pass environment variables as follows:

```shell
RESTATE_HOST=myhost RESTATE_HOST_SCHEME=https restate <command>
```

### Using a configuration file

You can also specify the configuration in a `.env` file. The CLI will look for a `.env` file in its current directory.

For example, to connect to a Restate admin server running at `http://myhost:9070`, save the following in a `.env` file:

```shell .env
RESTATE_ADMIN_URL=http://myhost:9070
```
