# Versioning

Restate comes with different solutions to update the services, to simplify development and evolution of your codebase without sacrificing Restate's strong guarantees.

## Inspecting deployments

To check which deployments are currently serving your services, do the following:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

        ```bash
        restate services list
        ```


        <details className={"grey-details"}>
            <summary>Output</summary>

            ```shell
            NAME             REVISION  FLAVOR  DEPLOYMENT TYPE  DEPLOYMENT ID
            # mark[57:82]
            ðŸŒŽ  TicketObject     1                 HTTP 2           dp_14LsPzGz9HBxXIeBoH5wYUh
            # mark[57:82]
            ðŸŒŽ  CartObject       1                 HTTP 2           dp_14LsPzGz9HBxXIeBoH5wYUh
            # mark[57:82]
            ðŸŒŽ  CheckoutService  1                 HTTP 2           dp_14LsPzGz9HBxXIeBoH5wYUh
            ```

        </details>

        To list only the deployments, you can do `restate deployments list`.

        Note that deployment IDs start with `dp_`. You can use it to describe the deployment:

        ```bash
        restate deployment describe dp_14LsPzGz9HBxXIeBoH5wYUh
        ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

        ```bash
        curl localhost:9070/services/Greeter
        ```

        <details className={"grey-details"}>
            <summary>Output</summary>

            ```json
            {
                "name": "Greeter",
                "revision": 2,
                // withClass highlight-line
                "endpoint_id": "Z3JlZXRlci12Mi8",
                [...]
            }
            ```

        </details>

        Note that deployment IDs start with `dp_`. You can use it to describe the deployment:

        ```bash
        curl localhost:9070/deployments/Z3JlZXRlci12Mi8
        ```

        <details className={"grey-details"}>
            <summary>Output</summary>

            ```json
            {
                "id": "Z3JlZXRlci12Mi8",
                "uri": "http://greeter-v2/",
                "additional_headers": {},
                "protocol_type": "BidiStream",
                "services": [
            {
                "name": "Greeter",
                "revision": 2
            }
                ]
            }
            ```

        </details>

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Deploying new service versions

As described in the [deployment docs](/deploy/overview), deployments are immutable, and are assumed to be reachable throughout the entire lifecycle of an invocation.
To deploy an updated version of a service, you need to deploy and register a new deployment.

For example, let's assume there is a `Greeter` service deployed at `http://greeter-v1/`.
To update it, we deploy a new revision at `http://greeter-v2/`, and then register it:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

        ```shell
        restate deployments register http://greeter-v2/
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

        ```shell
        curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json'
            -d '{"uri": "http://greeter-v2/"}'
        ```


        <details className={"grey-details"}>
            <summary>Output</summary>

            ```json
            {
                "id": "Z3JlZXRlci12Mi8",
                "services": [
            {
                "name": "Greeter",
                // focus
                "revision": 2
            }
                ]
            }
            ```

        </details>

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When the services at the new endpoint were already registered before, Restate will treat them as new revisions.
New invocations are always routed to the latest service revision, while old invocations will continue to use the previous deployment.
So new invocations will be routed to `http://greeter-v2/`, while existing invocations continue execution at `http://greeter-v1/` (e.g. sleeping/waiting invocations) until completion.

<Admonition type={"caution"}>
It must be guaranteed that the old deployment lives until all the existing invocations complete.
</Admonition>


<Admonition type={"info"} title={"State compatibility"}>
When updating Virtual Objects, the new revisions will continue to use the same state created by previous revisions. You must ensure state entries are evolved in a backward compatible way.
</Admonition>

## Removing services

You cannot remove a single service, but you can remove the deployment containing it.

**Before you remove a deployment, you need to ensure the following:**

1. Make sure that there are no other handlers with business logic that calls this service.
2. If several services are bundled in the same deployment, you can't remove only one of them. You have to remove the whole deployment.
So make sure that you first deploy the services you want to keep in a separate new deployment.
4. [Make the service private](/operate/registration#private-services) to avoid accepting new HTTP requests.
5. Check whether the service has pending invocations via _`restate services status`_, and wait until the service is drained (i.e. no ongoing invocations).

**When all prerequisites are fulfilled**, you can remove the deployment containing the service via:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate deployments remove dp_14LsPzGz9HBxXIeBoH5wYUh
```

If the deployment isn't drained yet but you still want to remove it, use the `--force` flag.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl -X DELETE localhost:9070/deployments/dp_14LsPzGz9HBxXIeBoH5wYUh?force=true
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
