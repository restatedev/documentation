# Control Clusters

Starting with version 1.2, Restate includes a command line utility to connect to and control running Restate servers called `restatectl`. This tool is specifically designed for system operators to manage Restate servers and is particularly useful in a cluster environment. It is distinct from the application developer-focused `restate` CLI tool, which is used to manage service deployments and invocations.

## Getting `restatectl`

You can install `restatectl` using your preferred [installation method](/develop/local_dev). The tool is also included in the `restate-cli` and `restate` Docker images. To use `restatectl` in a running Docker container, you can use the following command from the host machine to connect to it without spawning a separate container:

```shell
docker exec <CONTAINER_NAME> restatectl [ARGUMENTS]
```

## Connecting to remote servers

The `restatectl` tool communicates with Restate at the advertised address specified in the [server configuration](/operate/configuration/server) - by default TCP port 5122. To get an overview of a running server or cluster, use the `status` command:

```shell
restatectl status --addresses http://localhost:5122/
```
