# Control servers/clusters

This page describes how you can manage a running Restate cluster.

Starting with version 1.2, Restate includes a command line utility to connect to and control running servers called `restatectl`. This tool is specifically designed for system operators to manage the Restate servers, and is different from the application developer-focused [Restate CLI](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally) which is used to manage service deployments and invocations.

## Getting `restatectl`

<Tabs groupid="invoke" querystring>

<TabItem value="release" label="Install via `npm`" default>
    Only available after release of version 1.2

    ```shell
    npm install @resatedev/restatectl
    npx restatectl [ARGUMENTS]
    ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="`restate-cli` docker image" default>
    `restatectl` is part of `restate-cli` image (version >= 1.2)
    ```shell
    docker run --net host --rm -it --entrypoint restatectl ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-cli [ARGUMENTS]
    ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="local" label="Locally-running Docker container">
    If you are running a Restate server in a Docker container, you can use the following command from the host machine to connect to it without spawning a separate container:

    ```shell
    docker exec <CONTAINER_NAME> restatectl [ARGUMENTS]
    ```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can create a shell alias for your preferred method to start `restatectl`; in the future we will offer more options to install the binary directly. From here on, we will refer to the command as just `restatectl` assuming that it expands to one of the definitions above.

## Connecting to remote servers

The `restatectl` tool communicates with the Restate server at the server `advertised` address specified in the [server configuration](/operate/configuration/server) - by default TCP port 5122. To get an overview of a running server or cluster, use the `status` command:

```shell
restatectl status --addresses http://localhost:5122/
```
