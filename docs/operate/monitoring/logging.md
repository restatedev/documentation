# Logging

By default, Restate logs INFO, WARN and ERROR events using a pretty format.

A complete list of configuration options is available in the [configuration documentation](/operate/configuration/server).

For service logging, check the [Typescript SDK logging](/develop/ts/logging) and [Java SDK logging](/develop/java/logging) pages.

## Log filter

You can modify the filter used for log events setting the configuration entry `log-filter`, or alternatively setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. Check the [`RUST_LOG` documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) for more details about the filter format. For example to enable debug logs on all restate components, and info on other logs, set the filter as `info,restate=debug`. See the paragraph below [components and log events](#components-and-log-event-context-fields) for more details about filter targets.

## Log format

You can modify the log format by setting the configuration entry `log-format` (or via `restate-server --log-format=<FORMAT>`) as follows:

* `pretty`: Very verbose pretty format with rendered error descriptions, when available
* `compact`: Compact single line format
* `json`: Newline delimited json format

## Components and log event context fields

The following components are producing relevant logs:

* `restate_ingress_http`: The Restate component ingesting HTTP requests
* `restate_admin`: The component responsible for holding the metadata information and executing service discovery
* `restate_invoker`: The component interacting with deployed service deployments
* `restate_worker::partition::state_machine`: The state machine effects
* `restate_partition_store`: Restate partition storage layer
* `restate_bifrost`: Restate durable log layer
* `hyper`: The HTTP library

Most log events generated by Restate will also have the following attached attributes:

* `rpc.service`: The related service
* `rpc.method`: The related method
* `restate.invocation.id`: The [invocation identifier](/operate/invocation#invocation-identifier)

## Recommendations

When testing Restate locally, we recommend keeping the default configuration.

When deploying in production, we recommend setting the log level to `info` and enabling the `json` format in conjunction with a log collector, so you can later inspect and filter logs based on its event fields.

We recommend to set up logging to a more verbose filter, and use the `pretty` format. Some example filters:

* `info,restate_ingress_http=trace,restate_invoker=trace,restate=debug,hyper=debug` for network related issues
* `info,restate_worker::partition::effects=debug` to get insights on the state machine effects
* `info,restate_admin=trace` to check service discovery and registration
