# Tracing

Restate supports the following tracing features:

* Runtime execution tracing per invocation
* Exporting traces to OTLP-compatible systems (e.g. Jaeger)
* Correlating parent traces of incoming HTTP requests, using the [W3C TraceContext](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context) specification.

## Setting up OTLP exporter

Set up the [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlpexporter/README.md) by pointing the configuration entry `tracing-endpoint` to your trace collector.

### Exporting traces to Jaeger

[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.46/deployment/) accepts OTLP trace data on port `4317`.
Start Jaeger with OTLP enabled. For example, locally with Docker:

```shell
docker run -d --name jaeger \
# withClass highlight-line
    -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
    -p 4317:4317 -p 16686:16686 \
    jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.46
```

Configure the tracing endpoint in Restate as a fully specified URL.
For example, locally with Docker:

<CH.Code rows={"3"}>

    ```shell npx
    npx @restatedev/restate-server --tracing-endpoint http://localhost:4317
    ```

    ``` shell Homebrew
    brew install restatedev/tap/restate-server &&
    restate-server --tracing-endpoint http://localhost:4317
    ```

    ```shell Docker
    docker run --name restate_dev -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 \
        -e RESTATE_TRACING_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:4317 \
        --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
    ```

</CH.Code>

<details className={"grey-details"}>
    <summary>Specifying additional tracing headers</summary>

    You can specify additional headers to be sent with the trace data by setting the `tracing-headers` configuration entry.
    For example, to specify an `authorization` header add the following snippet to the [configuration file](/operate/configuration/server/#configuration-file):

    ```toml
    [tracing-headers]
    authorization = "Bearer some-auth-token"
    ```
</details>

If you now spin up your services and send requests to them, you will see the traces appear in the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686:

<Admonition type="info" title={"Filtering traces"}>
    You can configure a span/event filter in a similar fashion to the [log filter](/operate/monitoring/logging#log-filter) setting the `tracing-filter` configuration entry.
</Admonition>

<details className={"grey-details"}>
    <summary>Setting up Jaeger file exporter</summary>

    If you can't configure a Jaeger agent, you can export traces by writing them to files, using the Jaeger JSON format.
    To do so, set up the configuration entry `tracing-json-path` pointing towards the path where trace files should be written.

    You can import the trace files using the Jaeger UI:

</details>

## Understanding traces
The traces contain detailed information about the context calls that were done during the invocation (e.g. sleep, one-way calls, interaction with state):

<img src="/img/tracing_span_tags.png" width={"75%"}/>

The initial `ingress_invoke` spans show when the HTTP request was received by Restate. The `invoke` span beneath it shows when Restate invoked the service deployment to process the request.

The tags of the spans contain the metadata of the context calls (e.g. call arguments, invocation id).

<Admonition type="info" title={"One-way call traces are detached from the parent"}>
When a service invokes another service, the child invocation is linked automatically to the parent invocation, as you can see in the image.
Note that the spans of one-way calls are shown as separate traces. The parent invocation only shows that the one-way call was scheduled, not its entire tracing span.
To see this information, search for the trace of the one-way call by filtering on the invocation id tag `restate.invocation.id="inv_19maBIcE9uRD0gIu30mu6eqhZ4pQT"`.
</Admonition>

## Searching traces

Traces export attributes and tags that correlate the trace with the service and/or invocation. For example, in the Jaeger UI, you can filter on the invocation id (`restate.invocation.id`) or any other tag:
