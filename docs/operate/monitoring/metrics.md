# Metrics

Restate servers expose operational metrics in [Prometheus exposition format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md) via the [Node-ctrl](/deploy/overview#exposed-ports) endpoint, i.e. `localhost:9070/metrics`. For instance, configure Prometheus to scrape this endpoint every 30 seconds by adding this section to Prometheus configuration (assuming restate server's IP address is `10.10.10.1` and accessible by Prometheus:

```yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: restate_server_1
  metrics_path: "/metrics"
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - 10.10.10.1:5122
```

Note that some metrics are dependent on the value of `rocksdb-statistics-level` in the configuration file. In most cases, the default value will be sufficient for production deployment monitoring.


## Example Metrics

This is a non-exhaustive list of metrics that can be used to measure system performance:
* `restate_ingress_requests_total` (counter) - Number of ingress requests in different states (admitted, completed, throttled, etc.)
* `restate_ingress_request_duration_seconds` (summary) - Total latency of Ingress request processing in seconds
* `restate_rocksdb_estimate_live_data_size_bytes` (Gauge) - Size of the live data in RocksDb databases in bytes
* `restate_invoker_invocation_task_total` (counter) - The number of invocation tasks to user handlers

For example, we can use the following Prometheus queries to visualize throughput (ops/s) of HTTP ingress requests with an overlay of P99 latency:
```javascript
rate(restate_ingress_requests_total{job="restate_server_1"}[$__rate_interval])
```

```javascript
restate_ingress_request_duration_seconds{job="restate_server_1", quantile="0.99"}
```
