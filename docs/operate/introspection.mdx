# Introspection

Restate exposes information on invocations and application state via its CLI and [Introspection SQL API](/references/sql-introspection). You can use this to gain insight into the status of invocations and the service state that is stored.

This can be useful for troubleshooting. For example, a Virtual Object might be blocked and you want to kill the invocation that is blocking it, but you don't know the invocation ID. Or you want to check what is currently stored in the state of a service.

You can inspect what is stored in Restate via the UI, via the CLI (via commands or SQL queries), and via psql.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Restate UI for understanding your applications">
    You can use the [UI](/develop/local_dev#restate-ui) to debug your applications.
    Have a look at the [UI announcement blog post](https://restate.dev/blog/announcing-restate-ui/) to get some inspiration on how you can use the UI for debugging and understanding your applications.

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

The CLI is the easiest way to get started with introspection.
Have a look at the [installation guide](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally) for the CLI.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="SQL">

    Restate exposes the following SQL tables:
    - `sys_invocation` table to inspect invocations
    - `sys_inbox` table to inspect queue of pending invocations
    - `sys_keyed_service_status` table to inspect the status of a Virtual Object
    - `sys_journal` table to inspect the invocations' journal
    - `sys_service` table to inspect the registered services
    - `sys_deployment` table to inspect service deployments
    - `sys_idempotency` table to inspect idempotency keys
    - `state` table to inspect application state

    You can find the schema of each of the tables in the [references](/references/sql-introspection).

    You can query the tables with the CLI via:

    ```shell
    restate sql "<QUERY>"
    ```

    <details className={"grey-details"}>

        <summary>Alternative: use `psql` client</summary>

        [Install the *psql* client](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

        Connect with *psql* to Restate:

        ```shell
        psql -h localhost -p 9071
        ```

        You can change the default port `9071` by supplying the `-p` argument.

        To retrieve the schema of the any of the tables, connect the *psql* client to Restate and execute:

        ```sql
        describe <TABLE_NAME>;
        ```

        For example:

        ```sql
        describe sys_invocation;
        ```

    </details>


    The Restate Introspection SQL API has been implemented based on [DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) and supports standard SQL syntax.

## Inspecting invocations

### Listing ongoing invocations

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

    ```shell
    restate invocations list
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

    ```sql
    select * from sys_invocation;
    ```

    <Admonition type="info">
        The `sys_invocation` table only contains entries for active invocations. Active invocations are invocations that haven't completed yet and are either invoked or suspended.
    </Admonition>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Retrieving the status of an invocation

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">


        ```shell
        restate invocations describe <INVOCATION_ID>
        ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

```sql
select target_service_name, target_handler_name, status from sys_invocation where id = '<INVOCATION_ID>';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The status is either:

* `pending`: enqueued waiting for its turn
* `ready`: ready to be processed, but not yet running
* `running`: actively processing
* `backing-off`: retrying due to a failure
* `suspended`: waiting on some external input (e.g. request-response call, awakeable, sleep, ...)
* `completed`: completed (this is shown only for idempotent invocations)

### Inspecting the invocation journal

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations describe <INVOCATION_ID>
```

You see the journal printed in the output.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

You can retrieve the journal of an invocation by querying the `sys_journal` table:

```sql
select * from sys_journal where id = '<INVOCATION_ID>';
```

If you don't know the invocation id of your request, you can find it in the `sys_invocation` table as described [above](#listing-ongoing-invocations)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Inspecting invocation retries

To have a look at the invocations that are currently in a retry loop, you can execute:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations list --status backing-off
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

```sql
select * from sys_invocation where retry_count > 1;
```

The metadata around these attempts is not committed durably to storage, but is held in memory in the invoker component.
This metadata can be found in the `sys_invocation` table.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Listing invocations that are blocking a Virtual Object

You can retrieve the invocation ID that is currently blocking a Virtual Object via:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations list --service <SERVICE> --key <KEY>
```

Or list all invocations that are blocking any Virtual Object:

```shell
restate invocations list --virtual-objects-only
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

```sql
select invocation_id from sys_keyed_service_status where service_name = 'test.MyServiceName' and service_key = 'myKey';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can then use the invocation ID to [kill the invocation](/operate/invocation#cancelling-invocations).

### Checking the last time an invocation was modified

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations describe <INVOCATION_ID>
```

Check the `Modified at` field in the invocation information in the output.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

```sql
select modified_at from sys_invocation where id = '<INVOCATION_ID>';
```
This includes any modification to the row in the table (e.g. when the service last switched its status from `invoked` to `suspended`, or when the last journal entry was added).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Checking how an invocation was triggered
To find out if an invocation was triggered via the ingress or by another service:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations describe <INVOCATION_ID>
```

You can check this at the root of the tree in the invocation progress.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

```sql
select invoked_by, invoked_by_service_name, invoked_by_id from sys_invocation where id = '<INVOCATION_ID>';
```
The `invoked_by` field contains either `ingress` or `service`. If the invocation was triggered by another service, then the fields `invoked_by_service_name` and `invoked_by_id` will supply more information about the invoking service.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Retrieving the trace ID of an invocation

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations describe <INVOCATION_ID>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

```sql
select trace_id from sys_invocation where id = '<INVOCATION_ID>';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Afterwards, you can use this trace ID to [search for spans in Jaeger](/operate/monitoring/tracing#searching-traces).

### Listing inactive invocations

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
To list the oldest invocations that are not making progress:

```shell
restate invocations list --oldest-first --status pending,backing-off,suspended
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">
To retrieve all invocations that have not seen any activity for more than 1 hour:

```sql
select * from sys_invocation where to_timestamp(modified_at) <= now() - interval '1' hour;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Listing zombie invocations

Zombie invocations are invocations that are pinned to a specific deployment but that deployment was forcefully removed. You can list them by executing:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
restate invocations list --zombie
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">
This is not possible via only `psql`.

If you know the ID of the deployment that got forcefully removed, you can check if there are zombie invocations pinned to it via:

```sql
select * from sys_invocation where pinned_deployment_id = '<DEPLOYMENT_ID>';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Inspecting application state

To retrieve the state of a specific service and service key, do:

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

    <Terminal>
        ```shell !command
        restate kv get <SERVICE_NAME> <SERVICE_KEY>
        ```

        ```log !output
        🤖 State:
        ―――――――――

        service  counter
        key      bob

        KEY   VAL
        seen  8
        ```
    </Terminal>

    If the values are not JSON-encoded UTF-8 strings, then it is also possible to use the `--binary` flag,
    and get the value as base64 encoded string.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="psql" label="psql">

You can query the application state via the `state` table.

```sql
select * from state where service_name = 'test.MyServiceName' and service_key = 'myKey';
```

If your state value is a regular string, then you can access its content in the column `value_utf8`.

To retrieve the state of a specific service name, service key and state key, do:

```sql
select * from state where service_name = 'MyServiceName' and service_key = 'myKey' and key = 'myStateKey';
```

The state key is the name you used to store the state with the SDK. For example, the code snippet `ctx.set("count", 1)` stores `1` under the key `count`.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Joining the tables">
To join the `sys_invocation` and `state` table:

```sql
select * from sys_invocation JOIN state on sys_invocation.target_service_name = state.service_name and sys_invocation.target_service_key = state.service_key;
```
</Admonition>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### To edit application state

<Tabs groupId="interface" queryString  className={"display-none"}>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To edit the application state, do:

```shell
restate kv edit <SERVICE_NAME> <SERVICE_KEY>
```

This command opens your default editor (as configured in the `cli env`).
It sends the new state values back to the runtime to be applied.

Use `--binary` if the values are not JSON-encoded UTF-8 strings.
In this case, you need to decode the base64-encoded string, and encode it back to base64 after editing.

Use `--plain` to retrieve the state as a JSON object.
This can be useful in combination with tools like `jq` for example:
```shell
restate kv get counter bob --plain | jq '.seen'
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="Editing state during ongoing invocations">
If during the editing of the state with the CLI, an invocation changed the state as well, then the edit of the CLI will not take affect.
If you want the CLI state edit to be applied even if the state has changed in the meantime, then use the `--force` flag.
</Admonition>

An example on how to edit the K/V state of the service `counter` for the key `bob`:

    <Terminal>
        ```shell !command
        restate kv edit counter bob
        ```

        ```log !output
        ℹ️  About to write the following state :
        ―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――


        service  counter
        key      bob
        force?   false
        binary?  false

        KEY   VAL
        seen  8

        ✔ Are you sure? · yes


        Enqueued successfully for processing
        ```
    </Terminal>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
