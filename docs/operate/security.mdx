# Security

## Private services
When registering an endpoint, every service is by default reachable via HTTP requests to the ingress.

You can configure a service as `private`, such that you can't invoke it over HTTP, through the [UI](/develop/local_dev#restate-ui) or the Admin API ([docs](/adminapi/modify-service)):

```shell
curl -X PATCH localhost:9070/services/MyService --json '{"public": false}'
```

You can revert it back to public with `{"public": true}`.

<Admonition type="info">
    Private services can still be invoked by other handlers via the SDK.
</Admonition>

## Locking down service access
Only Restate needs to be able to make requests to your services - requests from
other services or from the ingress will always go via the Restate runtime. It is
therefore advisable to ensure that only Restate can reach your service.
Unrestricted access to the services is dangerous. If you're working with multiple Restate instances, you also may want to check that requests are
coming from the right instance.

To make this easier, Restate has a native request identity feature which can be
used in the SDK to cryptographically verify that requests have come from a
particular Restate instance.

To get started, you need an ED25519 private key, which you can generate using
openssl as follows:
```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -outform pem -out private.pem
```

You can provide the path to the key to Restate on startup using an environment
variable: `RESTATE_REQUEST_IDENTITY_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM_FILE=private.pem`.

On start, Restate will log out the public key in a convenient compact
format:
```
INFO restate_service_client::request_identity::v1
  Loaded request identity key
    kid: "publickeyv1_w7YHemBctH5Ck2nQRQ47iBBqhNHy4FV7t2Usbye2A6f"
    path: private.pem
```

You can also obtain the public key in this format without running Restate using
the following script:
<details className="grey-details">
    <summary>generate.sh</summary>
    ```shell
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    set -euo pipefail

    # generate private key
    openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -outform pem -out private.pem
    echo "Wrote private key to private.pem"

    base58_chars="123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    # encode public key
    encoded=$(openssl ec -in private.pem -inform pem -pubout -outform der -out /dev/stdout 2>/dev/null |
        tail -c +13 |
        basenc --base16 "${1:-/dev/stdin}" -w0 |
        if
          read
          [[ $REPLY =~ ^((00)*)(([[:xdigit:]]{2})*) ]]
          echo -n "${BASH_REMATCH[1]//00/1}" # leading 0s -> 1
          (( ${#BASH_REMATCH[3]} > 0 ))
        then
          dc -e "16i0${BASH_REMATCH[3]^^} Ai[58~rd0<x]dsxx+f" | # hex bytes to indexes into the char string
          while read -r
          do echo -n "${base58_chars:REPLY:1}"
          done
        fi)

    echo -n "publickeyv1_${encoded}" > public-key
    echo "Wrote publickeyv1_${encoded} to public-key"
    ```
</details>

The string `publickeyv1_w7YHemBctH5Ck2nQRQ47iBBqhNHy4FV7t2Usbye2A6f` does not
need to be kept secret and can be safely included in your code when providing to the
SDK. To learn how to provide the public key to the SDK, see the serving docs
for [TypeScript](/develop/ts/serving#validating-request-identity)
and [Java](/develop/java/serving#validating-request-identity)
