# Restate CLI

You can use the CLI to interact with Restate, and manage your services, deployments and invocations.

<Admonition type="note" title="Installing the CLI">
    Have a look at the [CLI installation docs](/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally).
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">
    The CLI can be a useful tool for debugging and troubleshooting.
    Have a look at the [introspection page](/operate/introspection) for a list of useful commands .
</Admonition>

There are 2 ways to configure the CLI: via environment variables or via a configuration file.

## Using environment variables

You can specify the following environment variables:

- `RESTATE_HOST`: The hostname/IP address of the server. Default is `localhost`.
- `RESTATE_HOST_SCHEME`: Default is `http`.
- `RESTATE_ADMIN_URL`: To specify the full URL of the admin server (scheme+host+port).
- `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN`: Set if authentication is required.

For example, to specify the hostname `myhost` and the host scheme `https`, pass environment variables as follows:

```shell
RESTATE_HOST=myhost RESTATE_HOST_SCHEME=https restate <command>
```

<Admonition type="info" title="All CLI configuration variables">
You can find the full list of configuration variables in the [CLI GitHub repo](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/blob/main/cli/src/cli_env.rs).
</Admonition>

You can also specify the configuration in a `.env` file. The CLI will look for a `.env` file in its current directory.

For example, to connect to a Restate admin server running at `http://myhost:9070`, save the following in a `.env` file:

```shell .env
RESTATE_ADMIN_URL=http://myhost:9070
```

## Using the config file

By default, the CLI will treat `$HOME/.config/restate` as its config directory.
This is configurable with `$RESTATE_CLI_CONFIG_HOME`. Restate will look for file
named `config.toml` inside this directory. You can edit this file with
`restate config edit`, or view its contents with `restate config view`.

The config file has a native concept of 'enviroments' which are sets of
configuration intended to specify different instances of Restate. You can
list your configured environments:

```bash
> restate config list-environments
CURRENT  NAME   ADMIN_BASE_URL
*        local  http://localhost:9070/
```

By default, the CLI uses the `local` environment which is configured to point
at a Restate instance running on your local machine. Additional environments
can be specified as new blocks in `config.toml`:

```toml config.toml
[myhost]
ingress_base_url = "http://myhost:8080"
admin_base_url = "http://myhost:9070"
bearer_token = "..."
```

The title of the block is the name of the environment. You can switch
between environments in various ways:

1. With an argument: `restate -e myhost whoami`
2. With an environment variable: `RESTATE_ENVIRONMENT=myhost restate whoami`
3. With the command `restate config use-environment myhost`. This will write
   the name of the environment to the CLI config directory, so that it's used by
   default for all CLI commands. You can switch back to `local` with
   `restate config use-environment local`.
