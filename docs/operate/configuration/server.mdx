# Restate Server

The Restate Server has a wide range of configuration options to tune it according to your needs.

## Configuration file

The Restate Server accepts a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) configuration file that can be specified either providing the command-line option `--config-file=<PATH>` or setting the environment variable `RESTATE_CONFIG=<PATH>`. If not set, the [default configuration](#default-configuration) will be applied.

## Overrides

Restate server accepts a sub-set of the configuration through command-line arguments, you can see all available options by adding `--help` to `restate-server`.

The order of applying configuration layers follows the following order:
1. Built-in defaults 
2. Configuration file (`--config-file` or via `RESTATE_CONFIG`)
3. Environment variables
4. Command line arguments (`--cluster-name=<VALUE>`)

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
Every layer overrides the previous. For instance, command-line arguments will override a configuration key supplied through environment variable (if set).
</Admonition>

### Environment variables
You can override any configuration entry with an environment variable, this overrides values loaded from the configuration file. To do that, the following rule applies:

* Prefix the configuration entry key with `RESTATE_` 
* Separate every nested struct with `__` (double underscore) and all hyphens `-` with a `_` (single underscore).

For example, to override the `admin.bind-address`, the corresponding environment variable is `RESTATE_ADMIN__BIND_ADDRESS`.

## Configuration introspection

If you want to generate a configuration file that includes values loaded from your environment variables or overrides applied to `restate-server` command-line, you can add `--dump-config` to dump the default TOML config with overrides applied:
```shell
restate-server --cluster-name=mycluster --dump-config
```
Example output:
```toml
roles = [
    "worker",
    "admin",
    "metadata-store",
]
cluster-name = "mycluster"
...
```

At any time, you ask restate daemon to print the loaded configuration to the log by sending a `SIGUSR1` to the server process. This prints a dump of the live configuration to standard error.

For instance on Mac/Linux, you can find the PID of restate-server by running:
```shell
pgrep restate-server
994921
```
Then send the signal to the process ID returned from `pgrep`'s output:
```shell
kill -USR1 994921
```
Observe the output of the server for a dump of the configuration file contents.


## Default configuration

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Tip">
Note that configuration defaults might change across server releases, if you want to make sure you use stable values, use an explicit configuration file an pass the path via `--config-path=<PATH>` as described above.
</Admonition>
