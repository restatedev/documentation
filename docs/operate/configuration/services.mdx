# Restate Service Configuration

Services have some configuration settings:

- Retention time of idempotency keys
- [Whether they are private or not](/operate/security#private-services)
- [Inactivity and abort timeout](/guides/error-handling#timeouts-between-restate-and-the-service)

These can be set via:
1. [**UI**](/develop/local_dev#restate-ui): click on your registered deployment and adapt the settings
2. **CLI**: execute the command, adapt the config file and save it:
    ```
    restate services config edit <SERVICE>
    ```
3. [**Admin API**](/references/admin-api#tag/service/operation/get_service): You can find an example of an Admin API request, in the [docs on private services](/operate/security#private-services)
