-------------------------
**What to write here**:

- Resilience of service invocations:
  - guarantees
  - retries
  - What happens when an invocation fails: network failure vs user code (vs possible SDK bugs)
  - retries + side effects: how users should use retry logic together with side effects to
  - configs we have for retries etc

- Runtime
  - What happens in case of a failure of worker/meta: current guarantees and maybe mentioning that will become distributed at later point in time
  - Link to error codes coming from the runtime
