# Quickstart
This guide takes you through your first steps with Restate.

<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites">
- Build tools for your programming language:
    - TypeScript: Latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v18.17.1 and [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 9.6.7
    - Java/Kotlin: [JDK](https://whichjdk.com/) >= 11
- Optional but recommended: [Install the Restate CLI](/operate/cli#installation)
</Admonition>

<Tabs groupId="sdk" queryString>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

<Step stepLabel="1" title="Get the project template">

Use the [Node template](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator) to get started.
This template includes a skeleton of a TypeScript Restate service:

```shell
npx -y @restatedev/create-app@latest && cd restate-node-template
```

Get all the dependencies and build tools:

```shell
npm install
```

</Step>
<Step stepLabel="2" title="Build and run the service">

Now, you are all set to start developing your service in `src/app.ts`.
You can run the app with `ts-node-dev` while developing:

```shell
npm run app-dev
```

Once you have implemented your service, build the app and run it:

```shell
npm run build
npm run app
```

This starts the greeter service on port `9080`.

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="3" title="Launch Restate">
<CH.Code rows={"2"}>

```shell npx
npx @restatedev/restate-server
```

``` shell Homebrew
brew install restatedev/tap/restate-server && restate-server
```

```shell Docker
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 \
    --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway docker.io/restatedev/restate:VAR::RESTATE_VERSION
```

</CH.Code>

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Single binary">
Restate is a single self-contained binary. No external dependencies needed. Check out our [download page](https://restate.dev/get-restate/) for other ways to run Restate.
</Admonition>

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="4" title="Register the service">

Now, we need to tell Restate where the service is running.
You can use the Restate CLI via `npx` or via a global `npm` install.
Alternatively, you can use `curl`:

<CH.Code rows={"2"}>

```shell CLI
restate dp add http://localhost:9080
```

```shell curl
curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```

</CH.Code>

If you run Restate with Docker, you need to use `http://host.docker.internal:9080` instead of `http://localhost:9080` to reach the service deployment.

Restate then sends a request to the service deployment to ask which services and handlers
are running behind this endpoint and will remember these.
After executing this curl request, you should see the registered services and handlers printed to your terminal.

</Step>

<Step stepLabel="5" title="Send requests to the service">

Invoke the function via:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/myservice/hello -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name": "Restate"}'
```

</Step>

Download Java Hello world example:

<CH.Code>

```shell CLI
restate example java-hello-world-gradle &&
    cd java-hello-world-gradle
```

```shell wget
wget https://github.com/restatedev/examples/releases/latest/download/java-hello-world-gradle.zip &&
    unzip java-hello-world-gradle.zip -d java-hello-world-gradle &&
    rm java-hello-world-gradle.zip && cd java-hello-world-gradle
```

</CH.Code>

</Step>
<Step stepLabel="2" title="Build and run the service">

You are all set to start developing your service.

```shell
./gradlew build
```

Open the project in an IDE and configure it to build with Gradle.
Run your service via:

```shell
./gradlew run
```
